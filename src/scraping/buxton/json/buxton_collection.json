Used a form of digital synthesis known as Phase Distortion to obtain a rich variety of dynamic timbres.  Could be used with batteries or plugged in to power. This one was given to me at the product launch. The inclusion of this synthesizer in the collection is as a small reminder of the diversity of keyboard types, and especially, as an example to shed light on chord keyboards.  In entering text, for example, chord keyboards are those where more than one key must be simultaneously pressed to enter a single character. Technically, this includes any keyboard with a SHIFT key.  Interestingly, piano-type like keyboards like that on the Casio-CZ-101 probably don’t conform to this definition of chording, despite its ability to play musical chords. On the other hand, flutes and trumpets definitely do fall within the definition.  Why? With piano-like keyboards, each unique note has a single unique key dedicated to it.  When one plays a chord, i.e., simultaneously presses multiple keys, the result is a chord of notes - the note associated with each depressed key sounds. On the other hand, with trumpet valves or flute keys, only one note is produced at a time. It is the combination of keys pressed (coupled with breath) which determines the pitch of that single note.  This is far closer to entering text with a chord keyboard, where each chord enters a single unique character.",

They are flush with the pad and have no mechanical movement.  There are however, small raised points to help position the hands on the keyboard eyes-free typing, but these still allow the fingers slide easily on the surface when gesturing, such as when emulating a mouse..   The keyboard is independent of the base.  It can be folded in half for compact portability.  It can also be placed conveniently over a laptop’s keyboard as a replacement which then also enables the gesture enhancements to be used on the road.  Although not obvious to the eye, this is the core technology which, after being acquired by Apple, evolved into the iPhone’s multi-touch capability.",

Besides being one of the best mobiles running Windows Mobile, this phone is of interest because it was released the same month as the 1st Generation iPhone.  Thus, it is a good candidate for comparison. As one expects even today, the Touch had Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, a (2 M-pixel) Camera, and  could be operated by finger or touch on the screen, or a D-pad - which surrounded the large Home button, -  with the thumb. Furthermore, there was a large suite of applications for it. While from many aspects the iPhone was far superior to the Touch, the Windows ecosystem was far ahead in terms of applications - that is, for a little over a year, when Apple finally realized that the killer app was not the phone, and opened the App Store, which brought a flood of third party developers which brought about a huge change in the mobile market. For me, due to its ease of use and convenient small size, the Touch was my primary phone for over a year.  These were interesting times!",

The potential benefit exists even if the QWERTY keyboard has a number pad, since these typically were integrated on the right side of the keyboard - the same hand with which most (i.e., right-handed) users operated their mouse.",

        "short_description": "This device has an 8.1\" display that incorporates a Wacom digitizer and stylus, which enables annotation with digital ink.  These features made it my favourite e-Reader at the time.",
        "buxton_notes": "iRex iLiad e-Reader. Announced December 2005 and shipped July 2006, this iLiad is the first e-Reader that I owned.  I bought it for a few reasons.  To explain the primary one, namely screen size, one needs to know something about e-Readers and pagination. The size of the screen of most e-Readers is about the same as that of a pocket book.  Hence, if the print version of the book was in that format, then what appears on the screen can be a pretty close facsimile of the print version - especially if the original did not incorporate colour. The challenge is what to do if the book was formatted for a page larger than the screen of the e-Reader?  There are really three options. Shrink the page to fit the screen.  If the size difference is small, this may be acceptable.  However, the chances are very good that this will make the page unreadable, especially for those - like me - of a certain age, where reading glasses are the rule rather than the exception. Keep the size, and show only part of the page:  This is kind of what we do with web pages that are too large for the window in which we are viewing them.  Yes, what you see is legible.  But also, there is a lot of fussing about having to pan around the screen, thereby interfering with the flow of reading, and also, preventing one from getting an overview of the page as a whole. Repaginate / Reformat the document:  this is what happens with many books.  If one does away with the notion of a predetermined page size, one can flow the contents onto the e-Reader screen on an \"as fits\" basis.  One of the benefits of this is that the option is there to change the size of the font (and therefore the amount of text on the page) to accommodate those who may be vision impaired, for example.  The bad news is that essentially all of the craft invested in the original book design - in terms of the placement of components, or layout, are lost.  In text only books, this may not be a huge issue - depending on the book.  But with books with a high graphic component - such as my Sketching book - it destroyed an important aspect of the book. As with most design options, there is generally never a single \"right\" (or \"wrong\") option.  It all depends on the person doing the reading, and their intent, the nature of the material being read, and the technology being used. For me, the fact was that most of what I need the e-Reader for was for unpublished documents that were in the form of PDF files formatted for 8 ½\" x 11\" (or A4), about 2,000 pages of which I needed to cart around with me on airplanes in 2006.  Hence, I went for the e-Reader with the largest screen at the time, this one, the iLiad. But there was one other factor that made this device my choice.  It was, and pretty much still is, the only e-Reader that came with a high-resolution stylus, and the capability to mark up documents with digital ink, and then transfer the marked-up versions to one’s PC to be sent on to the appropriate person.  I loved this. At this stage, one might ask, \"Why didn’t you just read the documents on your Tablet-PC?  It had a stylus and big screen!\"  Good point, and a relevant and interesting one.  Largely, it had a lot to do with the quality of the reading experience, size, weight, and battery life.  On planes, the experience is night and day, even taking into account how slow it is to turn pages with an e-ink display.  But more to the point, I did a lot of my reading outside, sitting in our garden.  That is one of the pleasures of reading.  It is a pleasure that is simply not possible with any slate-format device that has an LCD display - including (and perhaps especially) the iPad. But why didn’t I continue with the iLiad?  The answer is rooted in a couple things, the first of which is one of my main complaints with the design of far too many digital appliances.  Yes, it was wonderful to have this thin, light device with relatively long battery life.  But, no, I hated the amount of paraphernalia (power supplies, cables, etc.) that I had to carry around in order to use it (remembering that \"reading\" the words off of the page is just part of the broader activity of reading.  The other part was the quality of customer support and service.  As far as I can see, iRex was never large enough or well enough funded to properly support their product.  They were a classic example of the observation that it is not enough to have an innovative technology.  One needs an innovative company - technologically, business-wise, and from a design perspective.  They went out of business. But one last point, that plays on this last point, more than a little.  The iLiad came naked - just the bare e-reader (as do most).  Somewhere along the way, I bought the most expensive (circa $50) leather case for it - just to see how that affected my perception and use of the device.  The fact is, I was staggered at the result.  It transformed my relationship to it - even though it came close to tripling how thick it was.  It was no longer some hard cold consumer electronics device.  It became softer, more organic, and something that felt good to hold.  There is an important lesson in this somewhere. Bill Buxton April 2011",

        "short_description": "This device is an experimental mouse that was developed to explore the notion of the mouse itself being a self-centering joystick, such that rocking it to the side, forward, or backward would initiate scrolling in that direction, proportional to the degree of the tilt.",
        "buxton_notes": "The Rockin’ Mouse was one of those things that one had to try.  It was a project done in our research group at the 3D graphics software company, Alias|Wavefront, in 1996.  It was done by my colleagues, Ravin Balakrishnan, Thomas Baudel, Gord Kurtenbach, and George Fitzmaurice. We were working in 3D graphics, so were interested in exploring novel ways that might extend the number of degrees of freedom that we could control with a mouse, without degrading its performance in conventional tasks.  We were also aware of other initiatives with this intent, such as Gina Venolia’s  pioneering (1989) work at Apple, making the first scroll-wheel mouse, a replica of which (made for me by Venolia), is also in the collection. The idea that Ravin, Thomas, Gord and George pursued - I was not personally involved in the project, other than being the group head of the lab - was to make a mouse whose bottom was convex, rather than flat.  In so doing, one could move it and work the buttons like a normal mouse.  In addition, one could also - even while moving the mouse normally - rock it left-right and/or forward-backward, thereby gaining access to two additional degrees of freedom (motion in x and y plus tilt in x and y). In effect, the Rockin’ Mouse was a hybrid, integrating the control of a mouse with that of a joystick.  By way of example, consider the children’s Mickey Mouse roly-poly toy in the accompanying image.  Imagine gripping Mickey’s body.  You could then move it on the desktop like a mouse.  But, alternatively, or simultaneously, you could also tilt Mickey in any direction, and if you let go, the toy will stay in the same position on the desktop, and - on its own - return to its neutral vertical position (which is what makes a joystick \"self-returning\"). In considering this integration of mouse and joystick, it is an interesting exercise to compare this approach with that of the IBM Track-Point mice in the collection, which also incorporate a joystick. With the IBM mice, the joystick is mounted on the mouse, where here, the mouse body is the joystick - so much so that until you feel it, it is easy not to notice the \"joystickness\" of the device.  One aspect of this is that the same muscle groups control both motion and tilt, which contrasts with the IBM approach.  Each approach has advantages and disadvantages.  Neither is inherently \"right\" or \"wrong,\" which is what potentially makes the comparison exercise all the more informative. The way that the Rockin’ Mouse was actually implemented was to modify the mouse-shaped puck of a Wacom tablet by both adding the convex bottom, and adding position and tilt sensors from a Wacom stylus. The Wacom tablet acted as a \"mouse pad\", and by sensing relative motion rather than position when moving the puck on the tablet, the behavior was that of a mouse.  The tilt sensing was also captured, thus giving the four desired degrees of control.  Hence, despite the use of a tablet, it was still a relative controller, just with less conventional sensors. During the project, the team explored different form factors for the mouse before landing on the one shown here and used in the study.  Notably, in light of my earlier comments, one of them was in the form of a movable joystick. In the study, they had subjects move an object from one location to a target position in 3D space.  They compared the new mouse’s performance to that of a traditional mouse.  The results were positive, enough to suggest that the idea was worth further exploration - exploration that never really happened.  This, in itself, is worth pointing out, as it is something that frequently happens in research, where there is always a kind of triage that needs to be undertaken to decide which, of all of the things that one might pursue, you actually allocate the resources to do so.  The key thing here is that the field is full of such ideas, not abandoned because they were necessarily bad ideas;  rather, because there were other things deemed to be of higher priority to do. This is one of the reasons that innovation and invention need to look back, as well as forward, since a knowledge of the literature, i.e., classic scholarship, may well point the way to innovative and relevant solutions for today’s and tomorrow’s problems.  For example, if I were to revive the Rockin’ mouse, the first study that I would do would be to see how well it worked simply to integrate pointing and scrolling.  Instead of a scroll-wheel (which only scrolls in 1 dimension, normally vertically, one could just rock the mouse in the direction you want a document - such as a spreadsheet - to scroll, and it would do so at a rate proportional to the amount of tilt.  I would then compare that to existing 2DOF scrolling techniques such as touch pads, joysticks or trackballs, which have been mounted on top of mice. The deeper one goes, the more questions, and the more interesting questions, one encounters! References Papers: Balakrishnan, R., Baudel, T., Kurtenbach, G. & Fitzmaurice, G. (1997).

        "short_description": "The AlphaSmart Pro is a \"smart\" keyboard.  Connected to a computer, it behaves like any other.  Disconnected, it can capture what you type, and support limited text editing. This is possible due to its internal battery-powered microprocessor and LCD display. Typed material is stored as files in the keyboard’s memory and can be uploaded to a host computer when connected by a cable. Text can also be transferred from the host computer to the AlphaSmart Pro.",
        "buxton_notes": "This is a curious product in terms of timing. It is essentially a keyboard that can function normally with a computer, or as a stand-alone keyboard with memory.  It remembers what you have typed and lets you view and edit it on a small built-in screen capable of displaying four 40-character long lines at a time.  Up to 8 documents can be stored and edited on the device.  Stored material can be transferred to a host computer.  Of course, the AlphaSmart Pro is itself a battery-powered portable computer. It just has very limited functionality - but also a commensurate low price. There are benefits to this type of device.  If one had a desktop computer, this keyboard provided a reasonably portable, battery powered, device for note taking.  In a classroom, students might have their own self-contained keyboard, and when they needed to print things out, for example, connect it to a shared printer-equipped computer. As the price of personal computers dropped and their capability increased, the conditions which gave rise to this type of intermediate product were greatly reduced, along with the potential market size, and therefore the viability of the associated business.  In addition, there were other products on the market which had similar capability - in some cases as well as greater functionality. One example in the collection is the 1982 Microwriter. While a one-handed chord keyboard, it incorporated comparable typing and word-processing capabilities as well as the ability to function as an alternative keyboard and transfer files to/from a host computer. Another example which is worthy of comparison is the 1984 Radio Shack TRS-80 Model 100. While released 12 years earlier, besides comparable capabilities, it was a very capable portable computer for its price and size, and was a favourite of journalists, for example, who needed a portable word-processor which enabled them to write and edit stories in the field, and file them with their editors digitally over the phone. Finally, the dropping price of laptops pretty-much killed the market for this kind of product.  One of the prime take-aways from this example is to be wary  about trying to build a business around a niche market which, rather than growing, is inevitably going to essentially disappear due to foreseeable market dynamics.  There must be very rare circumstances to counter this rule, even when the short-term financials of that niche appear very attractive.",

It is of special interest as it was, to the best of my research, the first commercially released wireless computer keyboard. It used infra-red (IR) light to communicate with the computer. It is distinguished by its \"Chicklet\" keys as well as two other related things. First, key-cap labels were placed adjacent to the keys rather than on the caps. Second, it was designed to enable templates to be fitted over the keyboard, which enabled custom relabeling of any or all the keys.",
        "buxton_notes": "……Refer to the Time Magazine article.  Note that while announced before the Mac, it shipped after.  and, while it may have looked good pre-Mac, it was far less so after. First, there was the price.  Second, the keyboard, which did not meet the standards of professionals dependent upon typing.   Third, the computer was not compatible with many IBM PC core applications, especially the \"killer-app\" of the day:  Lotus 1-2-3 (which did run on the less expensive Apple ][ computer. The keyboard could be tethered to the computer via a cable, or function wirelessly, via Infra-Red (IR) light, powered by 4 AA batteries. Templates ….. The keyboard was pretty much universally panned as being sub-standard. In his review on page 301 of the June 1984 issue of Byte Magazine, Rich Malloy suggested that the keyboard was intentionally bad in order to prevent the PCjr eating into sales of the higher-end IBM PC.  He wrote, \"Worse than even the PC’s keyboard, this [the PCjr Freeboard Keyboard) should set a new standard for intentional product handicapping.\"",

Note: Lyons, et al. abstract: An experienced user of the Twiddler, a one--handed chording keyboard, averages speeds of 60 words per minute with letter--by--letter typing of standard test phrases. This fast typing rate coupled with the Twiddler's 3x4 button design, similar to that of a standard mobile telephone, makes it a potential alternative to multi--tap for text entry on mobile phones. Despite this similarity, there is very little data on the Twiddler's performance and learnability. We present a longitudinal study of novice users' learning rates on the Twiddler. Ten participants typed for 20 sessions using two different methods. Each session is composed of 20 minutes of typing with multi--tap and 20 minutes of one--handed chording on the Twiddler. We found that users initially have a faster average typing rate with multi--tap; however, after four sessions the difference becomes negligible, and by the eighth session participants type faster with chording on the Twiddler. Furthermore, after 20 sessions typing rates for the Twiddler are still increasing.",

        "title": "Casio C-801 Calculator Alarm Watch",
        "short_description": "The C-80 series of watches, released in 1980, were the first Casio calculator watches.  There were three models, differentiated by the materials and colours used, but electronically and functionally all were identical. The calculator supported four functions:  add, subtract, multiply and divide.  The watch also provided day, month, year information and incorporated stop-watch functionality.",
        "buxton_notes": "The Casio C-801-1 was one of a family of three digital watches, all released in 1980, which constituted Casio’s first calculator watches.  They all contained the same electronics - Module 133 - but differed in the style and/or materials of the casing and strap.  The C-801 and C-701 had stainless steel housings and straps, while the less expensive C-80 version’s strap and casing was in black plastic (images of it can be seen in the two accompanying advertisements, which date from the same year. This watch is largely in the collection to serve as a contrast to two other calculator watches with similar functionality.  Both from 1984, one is the TC-600, and the other, the AT-550.  Like the C-801, each was from Casio, had a stainless steel strap and casing, incorporated a 4-function calculator.  Each was set to calculator mode by pushing the bottom button on the left-hand side of the casing. What was different was the nature of the interaction through which the calculator was operated. The C-801, like most calculator watches, had a mechanical keypad incorporated into the watch casing.  The 12 buttons on the keypad were used to enter the digits 0 - 9 as well as the decimal \".\", and the addition \"+\" operator.  From top-to-bottom, the four buttons on the right hand side of the device were used to enter the divide \"÷\", multiply \"×\" and  subtract \"-\"and equals \"=\" operators. In contrast, the TC-600 and the AT-550 had no physical keypad; rather, their calculators were operated using a capacitive touch screen that covered the entire watch crystal.  But there was a significant difference between the two. Despite having a touch screen rather than a mechanical keypad, the TC-600 was nevertheless operated - like the C-801 - by pushing buttons on a keypad; however, in its case, the keypad was virtual.  It appeared as a picture on the face of the watch, and the buttons were \"pushed\" by touching the watch crystal directly above where the number or operator appeared. On the other hand, the AT-550 had neither a mechanical or virtual keypad. Instead, the watch crystal (the glass face) was a capacitive touch screen.  Using this, one could enter the digits and operators for the desired calculation by simply \"writing\" each on the touch screen using a finger.  The watch software then recognized what character had been written/drawn, and then entered it into the calculator just as if it had been entered with a keypad.. What makes the contrast amongst these three watches especially interesting is that, arguably, the two keypad watches have more in common than the two touch-screen watches.  After all, if you know how to use the C-801, you know how to use the TC-600, and vice versa.  Yet, knowing either, or both, of them will be of no help in figuring out how to use the AT-550. The lesson here is that the physical technology used in the user interface, touch-screen vs mechanical keypad, pales in comparison in terms of usage, when compared to the underlying conceptual model (calculator keypad vs character recognition).  In this day and age, this example cautions us as to the risk of referring to something as, \"a touch-screen interface.\"  Other than telling me one of the technologies used, this tells far less than most people think - as this example proves.",

        "buxton_notes": "This is a Bluetooth optical mouse that has an integrated trackball rather than a scroll wheel.  It can function in two modes.  First, it can operate as a mouse, with the trackball being used for 2D scrolling (up-down and left-right), or, the mouse can be disabled and the trackball used as the pointing device instead, with the mouse’s buttons retaining their normal function in either mode. One might wonder why anyone would want to switch the mouse to the trackball mode, since in general, pointing with the mouse is more effective, and in mouse mode, the ability to scroll both vertically and horizontally using the trackball can be very useful - especially with large spreadsheets.  While that is true on your desktop, it is not the case when flying economy, and your workspace is constrained by the limited space afforded by a seat-back table supported laptop.  The slim design and dual mode were purposely tailored to the road-warrior. The mouse’s mode is toggled by holding down the back end of the silver plate surrounding the trackball for 3 seconds.  As shown in one of the photographs, a successful switch is indicated by the word Mode being illuminated under the silver plate. Battery life is indicated by the green lights on the back of the device, which appear for about 5 seconds when the device is turned on or off. The challenge with both the Mode and the power lights is that they are obscured by the finger pressing the plate above the Mode light, and the palm of the hand, which shields one’s view of the battery indicator lights when the mouse is grasped by the hand.  I, for one, never knew that either existed until I read the manual, months after using the device on a daily basis.",

        "short_description": "This was the first portable Macintosh, and the first Mac which could be powered by an internal battery.  It was also the first clam-shell laptop with an integrated trackball which could serve as a mouse alternative.  The trackball could be placed to either the left or right of the keyboard to accommodate handedness. It also supported the Apple Desktop Bus (a predecessor to USB), which enabled other input devices, such as mice to be easily connected.  Likewise, it has an AppleTalk port, which enabled it to easily connect to one’s local area network. This was my go-to machine for a few years and I loved it.",
        "buxton_notes": "This was the first battery-powered Macintosh.  It was the first clam-shell laptop with an integrated trackball as a mouse alternative.  The trackball could be placed to either the left or right of the keyboard to accommodate handedness.  The very first models, of which this is one, had an active matrix display, which was wonderful for its time in terms of responsiveness and sharpness.  However, it did not have back lighting.  That is, like paper and e-ink displays, to be read, an external light source such as the sun or lamp was required.  On the positive side, the battery life was extended due to the reduced power consumption. While, at the time, one could get away calling this a portable.  In today’s lingo however, weighing in at 7.26 kg / 16 lbs., this machine would now be deemed a \"luggable.\"  Fact is, I knew that at the time that it came out.  But at the time that I got it, I was working with Mark Weiser’s Ubiquitous Computing team, and understood Moore’s law.  That is, I knew that the weight and size were going to rapidly drop, and that change was going to be significant in terms of how computers - namely portable computers - were used.  Hence, despite appearances (and reality) I treated this machine as if it was a modern lightweight portable and carried it with me everywhere for at least a year.  Office-to-office, up-and-down the PARC hallways, etc.  There is a reason that I have really long arms for my body size! My use of this machine was a great example of one of my maxims, namely: The only way to engineer the future tomorrow is to have lived in it yesterday. The more I carried it, the more used to doing so I got, so the size and weight disappeared.  And given that wifi was not commonplace at the time, having my digital stuff always with me on my own machined produced a valuable visceral sense of knowing in advance many implications of what was inevitably to come. That is the kind of attitude which drove most a PARC.  It was part of the culture.  And it goes a long way - coupled with encouraging management and brilliant determined people - to explaining why so much of what came in the next 25 years had roots in that lab.",

        "title": "Xerox PARCtab",
        "short_description": "This device is an important artifact of our early work on Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp) at Xerox’s Palo Alto Research lab (PARC).  I contributed the basic design of the form-factor, that is scale, shape, button position, and hand postures. A key inspiration was a trumpet.  In particular, like the valves of a trumpet, the buttons (valves) could be independently and simultaneously operated by three fingers of the holding hand. Hence, not only did this enable access to 7 virtual buttons by chording, the other hand was left free to interact with the screen with either a finger or stylus.",
        "buxton_notes": "One of three form factors used in the original UbiComp work.  The PARCtab was the hand-held mobile, the PARCpad was a slate device, and the LiveBoard was a large format whiteboard-type device.  All were able to be operated with a stylus. One of the key concepts in the design is that these different types of devices should be able to work seamlessly together.  While we never realized that objective, it was anticipated and reflected in their design.  The design of the PARCtab relative to the LiveBoard is an example.  Each was intended to work with its own personality on its own.  Yet, the decisions made in the design of the PARCtab were made in anticipation of the capability to sense proximity so that when working on the LiveBoard with its stylus using one’s dominant hand, the non-dominant hand could serve as an additional controller.  Furthermore, the stylus of the LiveBoard also worked on the screen of the PARCtab, so it would be simple to switch between these two cooperating devices. Remember, this was a time before multi-touch was viable on large displays, so this provided a means of bi-manual interaction. Notice that the device is intentionally symmetrical and is thus equally accessible for either left- or right-handed operation. Another Important attribute was its use of a pen-based shorthand for entering text: Unistrokes. Developed at Xerox PARC in 1993, the Unistroke alphabet represented each character by a unique glyph which could be drawn in a single stroke without lifting the stylus off the screen.  To maximize text entry speed, the most common characters used the fastest to draw shapes.  And, to minimize recognition errors, characters that frequently followed each other were designed to be easily differentiated from each other.  That way, when there was ambiguity, statistical probability could be the referee. Despite its elegance in terms of speed and efficiency once the character set was learned, Unistrokes was a failure.  Think about typing. People unfamiliar with the QWERTY keyboard can still type, albeit very slowly. The keycap labels enable them to hunt-and-peck. By analogy, with Unistrokes, you could only \"type\" if you could \"touch type.\" It was kind of like having to type on a QWERTY keyboard with no labels on the keycaps. The form of the shorthand characters did not graphically resemble that of the character which it represented.  One had to memorize the whole character set, and there were few mnemonic aids.  I am only aware of 2 or 3 people within Xerox PARC who made the required investment to learn the notation. However single-stroke shorthand alphabets which preceded and followed Unistrokes demonstrated that this problem could be significantly reduced by trading-off efficiency for the expert in exchange for learnability for the beginner.  The approach was to exploit graphical properties of the intended character in its shorthand form. And yes, there was a precedent for Unistrokes which did this.  A very old one. It was developed by a freed slave of Cicero, Marcus Tullius Tiro, around 63 AD, Notae Tironianae. Another single-stroke alphabet developed in 1996 for the Palm Pilot, Graffiti took the use of graphical similarities between shorthand and the character which it represented. even further than Notae Tironianae and achieved broad commercial acceptance. There are two tings of note here.  Despite being in existing texts on the history of writing systems, neither the devolpers of Unistrrokes nor Graffiti were aware of Notae Tironianae.  Second, despite much that has been written about the origins of Graffiti, despite its differences, its origin came directly from an awareness of Unistrokes.  This should serve as a reminder to take every claim of \"invention\" with a grain of salt.  There is almost always a precedent for any\" invention.\" Scholarship and research is a too-often neglected component of what passes for the process of innovation and invention.  Not knowing the history too often comes at the cost of starting from scratch, unknowingly reinventing the wheel, rather than starting at a much higher level by standing on the shoulders of the giants who preceded you. Finally, the PARCtab was a wireless PDA, if you like, which existed at a time before radio-based wireless communications such as BlueTooth or WiFi were generally available.  Hence, the PARCtab used infra-red (IR) light to transmit and received wireless information.  To accomplish it, each room had one or more ceiling-mounted IR transceivers.  To communicate, however, there had to be line-of-sight between the handheld and ceiling-mounted transceivers.  This had to be considered in the design.  Look again at the images of the PARCtab being held in the hand.  The back rests on the hand’s palm, with the screen facing up where it can be seen by the user, and the device can be \"see and be seen\" by the ceiling mounted device.  That is the purpose of the small protruding domed component beside the screen, on the other end than the buttons.  This is housed the IR transceiver.",

        "short_description": "A novel ergonomic QWERTY keyboard where the keyboard is split into half, each half being mounted vertically in order that it can be operated in a \"thumbs up\" position which results in the least constraint on the wrist.  As this renders the QWERTY keyboard hard to view, \"rear view mirrors\" are included to enable non-touch typists to \"hunt-and-peck\".  Less often used keys appear in a more conventional horizontal posture, between the two vertical sections.",
        "buxton_notes": "This keyboard has the distinction of being the only one in the collection with rear-view mirrors.  Its other distinguishing property is that the two halves of the keyboard are separated, with the numerical keypad in the middle, and each is vertically mounted.  These two features are not unrelated. The halves of the keyboard are vertically mounted in order to enable the hands to be in \"thumbs-up\" position while typing.  This results in less twist in the wrist, and therefore less contraction on the blood flow. It also results in one not being able to see the keys.  Hence the mirrors:  they let one \"hunt-and-peck\" when needed without undue head movement.  And, less frequently used keys (such as function keys) have their key-caps printed in mirror image so that they are seen right way around when viewed in the mirror. In the second photo, the flexibility in configuring the Comfort Keyboard can be seen in how it is set up in a manner emulating that of the SafeType V801 (minus mirrors!).

        "buxton_notes": "This is a post-WWII reflective stereoscope designed mainly for the analysis of stereo aerial photographs.   It is a modern variation of Wheatstone’s 1838 reflective stereoscope.  Manufactured by a company, Q.O.S. Corp., which was in business between January 1957 and December 1982.  This unit was built for the US Army Corps of Engineers, and based on a label, finished its life at the University of Colorado. This type of stereoscope was designed for critical field work, initially military reconnaissance. It therefore needed to find a balance between accuracy, portability and robustness.  This is reflected in the one-piece cast aluminum body, precision mirrors, and an adjustable base which could adapt to unlevel surfaces.  The case design was also an integral part of meeting the design criteria. Given its design, the MS-1 also found broad usage in equally demanding fields such as forestry, geology, mapping, and engineering, for example. Aerial photographs of up to 8\" x 8\" (203.2 x 203.2 mm) could be accommodated under the stand.",

        "short_description": "This was the first portable Macintosh, and the first Mac which could be powered by an internal battery.  It was also the first clam-shell laptop with an integrated trackball which could serve as a mouse alternative.  The trackball could be placed to either the left or right of the keyboard to accommodate handedness. It also supported the Apple Desktop Bus (a predecessor to USB), which enabled other input devices, such as mice to be easily connected.  Likewise, it has an AppleTalk port, which enabled it to easily connect to one’s local area network. This was my go-to machine for a few years and I loved it.",
        "buxton_notes": "This was the first battery-powered Macintosh.  It was the first clam-shell laptop with an integrated trackball as a mouse alternative.  The trackball could be placed to either the left or right of the keyboard to accommodate handedness.  The very first models, of which this is one, had an active matrix display, which was wonderful for its time in terms of responsiveness and sharpness.  However, it did not have back lighting.  That is, like paper and e-ink displays, to be read, an external light source such as the sun or lamp was required.  On the positive side, the battery life was extended due to the reduced power consumption. While, at the time, one could get away calling this a portable.  In today’s lingo however, weighing in at 7.26 kg / 16 lbs., this machine would now be deemed a \"luggable.\"  Fact is, I knew that at the time that it came out.  But at the time that I got it, I was working with Mark Weiser’s Ubiquitous Computing team, and understood Moore’s law.  That is, I knew that the weight and size were going to rapidly drop, and that change was going to be significant in terms of how computers - namely portable computers - were used.  Hence, despite appearances (and reality) I treated this machine as if it was a modern lightweight portable and carried it with me everywhere for at least a year.  Office-to-office, up-and-down the PARC hallways, etc.  There is a reason that I have really long arms for my body size! My use of this machine was a great example of one of my maxims, namely: The only way to engineer the future tomorrow is to have lived in it yesterday. The more I carried it, the more used to doing so I got, so the size and weight disappeared.  And given that wifi was not commonplace at the time, having my digital stuff always with me on my own machined produced a valuable visceral sense of knowing in advance many implications of what was inevitably to come. That is the kind of attitude which drove most a PARC.  It was part of the culture.  And it goes a long way - coupled with encouraging management and brilliant determined people - to explaining why so much of what came in the next 25 years had roots in that lab.",

        "title": "NewO Writehander",
        "short_description": "The Writehander is a twelve-button, one-hand chord keyboard.  The one pictured here is the left-hand version.  The four fingers sit on the four blue buttons in a row.  The thumb pushes one of the other eight coloured buttons.  The chords are the eight-bit ASCII code for the desired character, with the fingers defining the four low-order bits and the single thumb key pressed defining the four high-order bits..",
        "buxton_notes": "The Writehander is a chording keyboard released in 1978 that enabled one to enter text with only one hand.  It came in both a right and left-handed version.  I have one of each, but this one is the one designed for entering text with the left hand. One might tend to assume that the left-hand version of the Writehander is intended for left-handed people.  Generally, that is true if one is only typing.  Yet, if a right-handed person is using a mouse and Writehander together, it is most likely that the mouse would be used in the preferred right hand, and the Writehander in the left.  Furthermore, with chord keyboards capable of entering the full character set using one hand, it is generally the case that the highest typing speed is attained by assigning a separate keyboard for each hand, and alternating which keyboard is used to enter each successive character.  To understand this, test how fast you can tap on a table-top with your index finger.  Next, do the same thing, but alternated between the index fingers of one hand and then of the other.. The hemispheric form was designed to comfortably accommodate the hand laying over top of it with the four fingers resting on top of the horizontally-oriented curved row of four blue buttons, and the thumb in a position where it can activate any one of the vertically-oriented row of four pairs of coloured buttons (from top-to-bottom, blue, red, grey and black, respectively). Which character is entered is determined by the combination of the four blue finger buttons are depressed when one of the eight coloured thumb buttons is pushed.  That is, pushing the finger buttons has no effect until a thumb button is pushed.  Therefore, unlike playing a piano chord in music, the novice need not (but may) push all buttons in the chord simultaneously - as long as the thumb is the last one pushed.  Of course, high entry speeds depend on simultaneous, or near simultaneous chord entry. The total number of distinct characters that can be entered equals the number of thumb-buttons (8) times the number of combinations of the four finger buttons (16).  This comes to 128, which is enough to represent the full character set used in basic typing. The finger/thumb chord combinations used for the left- and right-hand versions of the keyboard are mirror-images of each other, which will facilitate transferring skill acquired using one hand device to the other. At the conceptual level, the chord combinations are based on what is known as \"7-bit ASCII coding\", which is an international standard for digitally representing characters in computers.  The four finger buttons correspond to the four least-significant bits in the 7-bit coding (the buttons for index finger - little finger correspond to b1 - b4, respectively).  The remaining three high-order bits are determined by which of the 8 thumb buttons is pushed.  The precise mapping for both the left- and right-hand versions of the device are shown in the accompanying Finger Code Charts.  A full user-manual is also included. Finally, while ASCII coding has been effective for computers, and has been used by other chord keyboards, its adoption is more likely in order to make things simpler technologically than for the human user.   Hence, one of the things to consider with chord keyboards is the choice of coding scheme involved.  The reason is that, unlike most keyboards, to enter text on a chord keyboard one must be able to touch-type.  Hence, learnability of the codes is a significant barrier to entry. The reason stems from the fact that any particular key may be included in the code for several different character codes.  Hence, labelling the key-caps in any useful way is difficult, if not impossible.  Thus, you cannot hunt-and-peck your way around the keyboard the way you can on regular ones.    Hence, the easier the finger coding is to learn, the easier that transition is for the user.  In order to emphasize that there are other codings, and ways to teach them, the reader is highly encouraged to compare the Writehander, with its coding and documentation, with another chord keyboard, the Microwriter, which is also in the collection.",

Based on http://www.digital-watch.com/DWL/1work/citizen-calculator-watch-59-2021/) Citizen introduced the first calculator watch in Japan and the first one in the world with LCD: the Citizen Quartz Crystron Calculator watch' the Caliber 9090 (or 909), 59-2021.  In 1978 (1977?) second generation of this watch was released, the caliber 9130 (or 913), 49-9315, with three integrated circuits (equivalent of 30,000 transistors) and a new kind of display with a resolution two times higher than the original one. It had three power cells for two years of time display and 330 hours calculating. The calculator's keys were lined up around the edge of the watch. A third generation of the round Crystron Calculator Watch was also released, the 49-9421. Notes to self: Need to sort out proper product name. Likewise is there a difference between \"caliber number\" and \"module number\", and if so, what, and what is the confusion?  This one, for example, has 49-9315 on back.  Likewise, the previous generation module number seems to be 59-2021 \"To enter calculator mode, press the \"SW\" button on the top let side. The calculator features addition, subtraction, multiplication and division using floating point arithmetic along with a square root function and memory recall\"",

        "short_description": "This is a 2012 replica of what I believe to be the first scroll-wheel mouse - that is, a mouse which has an integrated wheel which enables a document to be scrolled.  The original was built and first publicly shown in 1989 by Gina Venolia of Apple’s Advanced Technology Group.  It was a prototype which was never sold.  This replica was made by Gina, who built it especially for the collection.",
        "buxton_notes": "To the best of my knowledge, the first mouse publicly disclosed which incorporated a scroll wheel was built in 1989 by Gina Venolia of Apple Computer’s Advanced Technology Group.  It was a prototype made by hacking two of the just released Apple Desktop Bus (ADB) mice.  The ADB was a precursor to the now-ubiquitous Universal Serial Bus (USB).  The beauty of the ADB (and the USB) is that it supported \"plug-and-play\", which meant that one could plug and unplug input devices such as keyboards, mice, trackballs, etc without having to first shutting down the host computer.  Even more significant for our purposes was that one could daisy-chain multiple input devices together and have the computer react to all of them.  Normally, this would mean a keyboard and a mouse.  However, one could also add a second mouse, for example, and this was the property which Gina Venolia exploited in her hack. Now normally, plugging in two mice doesn’t make a lot of sense, since - by default - they would both exercise control over the same cursor/pointer on the screen.  Hence, using them together would result in a tug-of-war, so to speak.  And, yes, if you simultaneously moved one to the right and the other to the left the same speed, you could make the cursor stay more-or-less still since the movement of one would cancel out that which would otherwise be caused by the other. But what if the computer could sense which signals came from which mouse?  Then you would be able to over-ride the default behavior of having both control the cursor, and rather, assign the signals from one of them to control something else.  That is what Gina did.  She de-coupled the signals from one mouse from the cursor, and used that of one of its two shaft-encoders (the things which normally sense left-right and up-down mouse motion) and had it control vertical scrolling of the current document. Technically this worked fine.  However, it was awkward and wasteful to dedicate two hands to something that could more efficiently be done by one.  What she did, then, was extract the shaft encoder from one mouse and glue it on the side of the other in order that it could be turned by the thumb of the mouse-holding hand.  Furthermore, she added a cylindrical roller to the shaft to make controlling the amount and direction of the shaft rotation more easily controlled by the thumb. Electronically, this was a pretty simple hack.  By using the electronics still in the cannibalized mouse, and hooking it up to the computer as well, the computer had no idea that it wasn’t simply dealing with two mice, each assigned to a different task, and with only one of the shaft encoders of one mouse sending any data.  The other lay dormant. While belaying Gina at the climbing gym - we were both working at Microsoft Research in Redmond at the time - I asked Gina if she would donate her prototype to the collection.  The answer (understandably) was a decided \"No.\"  At the time, she was dangling at the top of the climb waiting to be let down.  The negotiations continued.  The result was that she agreed to build me a replica if I found two of the original type of mouse which she used.  With the negotiations finished, I lowered her, and each of us held up our part of the bargain, and the replica is now in the collection.  And, yes, we did climb together again.  And I am grateful for the donation as well as our time working and climbing together. Apple did not release a mouse with integrated scrolling until the 2005 Mighty Mouse, which is included in the collection. It supported 2D (horizontal and vertical) scrolling by means of a small trackball rather than scroll wheel.",

        "buxton_notes": "There is a good chance that the last thought that comes to mind when you first see this device is \"Apple iPhone\".   However, one you know the history, that may change. This is a prototype capacitive multi—touch keyboard which was designed as part of an exploration of how such a device might enable the user to both type, use gestures, and perform mouse-type tasks all on the same device.  It this was possible, and if it could be accomplished with minimal training and at a reasonable expense, then it may lead to much more efficient input to computer systems - at least in some circumstances and especially for certain people. However, to test such ideas in practice, one needs to learn from people using the device.  One builds such prototypes to test such concepts in the lab with test participants before going to the expense of manufacturing actual product. The work which lay directly behind this prototype was the 1999 PhD thesis of a student, Wayne Westerman, at the University of Delaware.  Based largely on this work, Westerman and his advisor started a company, FingerWorks, to develop some of the core ideas commercially.  The development of this prototype was part of their FingerWorks initiative.  My understanding is that this is one of three such prototypes built for user studies.  This one was given to the Human-Computer Interaction group at the University of California San Diego for testing.  Several years later, it was donated to this collection by Prof. Jim Hollan who let the testing work. So, what about the iPhone?  How does that fit in?  Well, it turns out that the prototype worked well, and the product went into production.  The commercial version is also in the collection, the FingerWorks TouchStream keyboard, and a photograph of it beside the prototype accompanies this note.  The device developed a highly dedicated community of users, one of whom seems to have worked at Apple.  And, during the early discussions around designs for a new smartphone at Apple - what evolved into the iPhone - the idea of incorporating the multi-touch expertise of FingerWorks not only came up, they bought the company in order to bring it to fruition. So, the next time you use a device with a capacitive multi-touch screen, think of this prototype and ask yourself, \"If I couldn’t see any connection between this thing and one of the most successful products of the past 50 years, what else am I missing?  How can I better learn to see the value behind what otherwise appears to be a crude non-descript gadget?\" In terms of the latter question, providing a vehicle to help you down the path to addressing that second question is one of the prime reasons for this collection’s existence.",

        "buxton_notes": "Maltron is an interesting British company, founded in 1977, that brought a radical and distinctive approach to a fairly established and standardized product:  keyboards.  The design was driven by two related factors:  a desire to combat RSI, coupled with some observations of the human hand.  The idea was that if the form of the keyboard better fit the shape of the hand, as they saw it, there would be less stress and therefore less RSI. The aspect of the hand that they worked from is the curvature traced around the periphery of the fingers that can be observed when you look at the back of your hand with your fingers together.  The thought was that if they built the surface of the keyboard in the form of two concave bowls - one for each hand - the result would fit the hand much better than the traditional more-or-less flat traditional keyboard surface. The \"they\" in the above was businessman, Stephen Hobday, who founded the company and is now chairman, and a keyboard-training specialist from the local Technical College, Lillian Malt, after whom the keyboard and company were named. I had known about the company from pretty early in its history, but had never used one.  At the same time, with my interest in chord keyboards - especially the Microwriter - and with Edgar Mathias and the development of his keyboard (both in the collection) - I had developed an interest in one-handed keyboard design.  Hence, when I had the opportunity, I acquired this one-handed Maltron keyboard for the collection. When it arrived, it showed every sign of having had heavy use over the years.  I started to clean it up, but then stopped.  It struck me that if I made it look pristine, it would lose some of its impact - the ability to tell its own story:  that not only could it be used, but it was used … heavily. As Stephen Hobday wrote to me: … the single handed units were first made and offered as part of our range in 1989.  Since then there have been some changes to the design but essentially the concept is the same.  ….   At Stevenson College Edinburgh, one of the early users was a student who had only one hand.  She had endured many years of frustration but found that she quickly learned to key on her single-handed keyboard, and subsequently got a job ahead of some 50 other applicants. Many thousands of these keyboards have now been supplied to users in all parts of the world. Finally, I find PCD Maltron an interesting example of a particular kind of company - one that finds a balance between the tradition of specialized craftsmanship and the modern industrialized world.  There are a lot of companies represented in my collection, yet few of them have lasted, especially focusing on one basic thing.  Scale up and expand or disappear seems to be the dominant tendency.  It is good to have counter examples to remind us that there is more than one way to proceed.",

        "short_description": "In 1849, Sir David Brewster developed the first lenticular stereoscope - that is, a stereo viewer which employs lenses, rather than mirrors, to view the stereo pairs.  This viewer can be used with opaque or film transparencies.  To illuminate the former, there is a trap-door with a mirror on the back which - when open - reflects light onto the images.  When transparencies are used, the door remains shut and it is used much like a modern View-Master:  one holds it up to light, which passes through a translucent diffuser, and back-lights the transparencies.",
        "buxton_notes": "The first lenticular stereoscope - that is, one which employs optical lenses - was developed by Sir David Brewster in 1862.  This was a significant improvement on the far more cumbersome reflective stereoscope which had been introduced in 1828 by Sir Charles Wheatstone.  The main benefit was that it was the first practical portable stereoscope. Brewsters devices were manufactured in France by Jules Duboscq and were shown at London’s Great \"Crystal Palace\" Exhibition of 1851.  There they attracted a great deal of attention - not the least of which was that of Queen Victoria.  The celebrity endorsement which this brought to the technology played a significant role in the popularity of the devices.  By 1856, over ½ a million devices had been sold, and stereographs became the first mass purchased form of photographs.",

It incorporates a keyboard which enables annotations, searches, etc.  The main reason for its inclusion in the collection is how it integrates with its companion Amazon Kindle Lighted Leather Cover. Like all previous kindles, the Kindle Keyboard had an e-ink display.  This is a display technology which reflects light like paper, rather than emits light like most TVs and laptop displays.  Hence, without light shining on it, one cannot read what is on the display.  On the other hand, the screen is much sharper than a typical laptop screen at the time.  However, in bright sun, such as on the beach, the e-ink is far superior for reading. To address the reading in the dark issue, the Amazon Book has 2 slots on the left side into which its optional Lighted Leather Cover binding can snap into.  These not only lock the Kindle Book to its cover’s binding, they also provide an electrical connection between book and cover, which enables electricity from the Kindle’s battery to power a reading light integrated into the cover to illuminate the Kindle’s screen when the light is extended from the cover.",

Whereas the MousePen had a miniature track-ball in its tip - literally making a ball-point stylus-shaped mouse, the Thumbelina was a miniature trackball that could be hand-held, and could serve as a small, portable pointing device for laptops, for example. Appoint was acquired by a company called Fellowes, which continued to sell the Thumbelina, which while keeping the Thumbelina name on the manual, they branded it on the packaging as the \"Mini Trackball\".  See it in the collection.   Other than updating the software for later systems, the main difference between the two was a switch from a 3 foot to a 9 foot cable, so that the device could be used to control presentations while having some ability to walk around.",

This specific unit was custom painted by the company, which they gave me as a gift.  Its particular attraction to us went beyond 3D graphics.  We exploited the similarity of its hockey puck shaped grip with the jog-shuttle wheel/transport control found on most video editing workstations, and used it for controlling video, animation and audio sequences.",
        "buxton_notes": "The Magellan based on technology developed by the German Aerospace Research Establishment (DLR), and brought to market in 1993 by a German company, LogiCad3D.  In 1998, Logitech acquired 49% control of LogiCad3D, and took over marketing responsibilities for the company’s products.  In 2001 Logitech gained a majority control of LociCad3D, and in September of that year, it merged LogiCad 3D with another company which they had acquired, Labtec 3D.  Labtec 3D was the developer of another 3D controller, the SpaceBall, and as such, had been a competitor of LociCad 3D. Hence, the new Logitech subsidiary, 3Dconexion, became the main powerhouse in the category of 3D/6DOF motion control devices. As part of that merger, The Magellan was rebranded the SpaceMouse Classic within the 3Dconnextion product line.",

Because its surface is flat, the only way one knows that it is a QWERTY keyboard is by the graphical representation on its surface.  One types by placing one’s fingers on pictures of keys, rather than physical/mechanical keycaps.  Because of the lack of the tactile feedback associated with conventional keyboards, as expected, typing speed and/or accuracy will be compromised with this keyboard. And yet, this keyboard brings real value in certain situations, and in so doing, it provides a good example of the rule: Everything is best for something and worst for something else.

This is one of a number of capacitive touch-sensing input devices produced in the period around 1981 by Touch Activated Switch Arrays (TASA).  The others included a touch-sensitive linear controller, the Ferinstat, which could function as a linear slider/fader, for applications such as audio or process control.  These came in two lengths and are included in the collection.  There were also the Model 16 Micro Proximity Keyboards, which were 16-button keyboards, arranged in a 4x4 array of touch-sensitive buttons that included a touch-sensitive numerical keypad.  They also demonstrated a small, capacitive touch-sensitive touch pad, not unlike what one sees on today’s laptops, for example.",

There were two problems with this device.  First, the pen was terrible  surprising since Cross is a pen company.  The problem was that it had a lot of tip-travel that made it feel terribly spongy.  The other problem was that the digital version had no idea if or when you had flipped pages on the paper copy.  Hence, things could get out of sync.  But it was close to being good.",

        "buxton_notes": "While early 19-key versions were released in Japan and Europe in 2001, this first North American version was released in 2002, and had 20 keys. While only having 20 keys, the FrogPad provided access to the full character set normally available on a full-sized QWERTY keyboard.  That way one can get the full alphabet in upper and lower case, as well as all the numbers, punctuation, and special characters is not relying on one-key-per-character.  Hence, the FrogPad is a chord keyboard - but one that has more keys than the 5 - 8 seen on most.  The result is that at most, entering a character requires only 2 keys to be pressed.  The higher number of 1-key characters and the restriction to two key chords means that higher typing speeds are more likely on this device than chord keyboards with fewer keys but more complex, and fewer 1-key codes - all things being equal (such as quality of design of the key mappings). There are two layouts available for the device:  one for typing with the left hand, the other for typing with the right.  Each is a mirror image of the other, which reflects the mirror image layout of the hands. The interesting question that this provokes is this:  should a right-handed person use the right or the left-hand version of the device?  As always, the correct answer is, \"It depends.\"  In this case, one of the prime factors is this:  do you want to use it in conjunction with a mouse?  If so, then generally, you would likely be best to adopt a FrogPad that is designed for use by your non-mouse hand (most typically, your non-dominant hand).  The good news is, due to the mirror image mapping of the keys on the left- and right-hand keyboards, moving from one to the other should require only little adjustment. Of course, each instance of \"likely\", \"typically\", \"generally\" and \"should\" indicates something that could be tested and quantified, which is my way of providing a concrete illustration of when formal user studies can help shed light on design questions.

It was, if you will, a \"ball-point pen,\" It had a stylus form-factor with a very small mouse ball on the end.  Like a pen, it enabled the fingers to exercise fine control.  However, it took more time to acquire with the hand, compared to a mouse, and counter to what one is accustomed to with a pen, you could not lift it off of the surface to go quickly to a different position.  Rather, it had to be dragged, as it was a motion, rather than position, sensitive device.",
        "buxton_notes": "During the transition in the early 1990s from text/line oriented interfaces, such as DOS, to graphical user interfaces interface (GUIs) such as the Macintosh or Windows, most computers did not have an integrated pointing device.  There had been no apparent need to have a device devoted to pointing, selecting and dragging, for example.  The GUI changed that.  The challenge then was how to enable that functionality without having to buy a whole new computer? Just adding a mouse was one option - especially for desktop computers.  But what about laptops which need to be as portable as possible, hence minimum bulk, as well as be convenient to use on, for example, the seat-back table on an airplane?  Regular mice tended to be bulky, relatively awkward to carry and to operate on the limited space of an airplane seat-back table.  Consequently, products emerged which attempted to address this challenge. The MousePen was one attempt to do so.  It is literally a ballpoint pen.  That is, it is a miniature ball mouse it into the tip of a pen, or stylus, type form factor.  The resulting hybrid did not catch on, despite some favourable reviews.  The reason is that it tended towards the worst, rather than the best, of those two worlds, being a relative motion-sensitive pen and a hard-to-pick-up mouse..",

        "title": "IBM TrackPoint",
        "short_description": "The TrackPoint is a miniature isometric joystick located at the meeting point of the G, H, and B keys on the keyboard, which enables you to control the cursor on a laptop while keeping the form-factor small.  Just getting the transfer function right took a year!",
        "buxton_notes": "The Trackpoint. The trackpoint is a little device with a big story.  In this case, a story of the down-and-dirty, roll-up-your-sleeves, be persistent, aspect of innovation.  It is also a story that I would rather you hear from the person who told it to me, Ted Selker, the person mainly behind the technology.  So here it is, in his own words: Bill - let me tell you a little story about Trackpoint! It all started in 1984 when I got my handson Stewart Card and Tom Moran’s new book, Human Computer Interaction. I was amazed to notice that in the first reported mouse experiments by Bill English and Doug Englebart in the first few minutes people did better with a simple knee bar than with a mouse…. I thought, now a knee has no big representation on the pre-central gyrus of the central sulcus for perception or on the post-central gyrus for motion like the hand does…..  So, why would it start out doing better?  A few pages later I read some data that showed that going to the mouse took more than .7 seconds and coming back to the keyboard from it took more than .9 seconds…...  Ahha! , I said- if a hand doesn’t yet know how to use a mouse it won’t yet be better at pointing than if a knee that doesn’t yet know how to point … and so the time of transit to and from the keyboard will dominate. I went about thinking of places to put a pointing device that the hand could nab from the home row position… I tried in front of the keyboard … and yes made a mechanical claptrap that year that had X and Y excursion to do this.   I also played with an erasure on top of a X/Y joystick that the thumb would control below the space bar.   I considered a joystick between the hands, but then started working on using the J key as a joystick. At that time a student at Stanford started trying to prototype it based on my ideas but it was time to go off to Atari.  I thought about it there at Atari, but nothing ever got out of the Atari Sunnyvale research lab…. I wrote it up as a patent in April of 1984 or so and submitted it.  (I can get more data to you about this if you like)  I believe I happened to be talking about this idea at CHI around the Tektronix people… which begat J-mouse … years later after they left Tektronix. I went to PARC for a year… and did many fun things there with automatic graphic design to a narrow-waisted mouse that can be held like a pen….  I went to IBM In August of 1985 and I did tell them I had this patent pending. (I also had a stylus pointing device patent that should be more exploited.. but that is another story too).  So I didn’t work on it till a math department colleague Joe Rutledge who wanted to break out of the math world chose it as the idea I had he wanted to collaborate on.  We worked on it on the side to begin with… in 1987. Joe chose it instead of my big visual interface or intelligent user interface ideas because it seemed that it could change a current product in a noticeable way easily…. I thought of it as a science fair project that would take 6 weeks… I was wrong. I fixed a microscope that was being thrown out by reglueing its mirrors; I found an oscilloscope that wasn’t being used and then found an on piece of bench in the back of a lab to use.    At first my idea was to use conductive foam beneath a key as the joystick.  I put copper foil corners on the top and a foil bottom… I found that the conductive foam at Radio Shack didn’t have the hysteresis that the other chip-holding foam had. The sensor was great in that it was sensitive and fit under a key and was easy to make- but it sucked in that it was where I learned about the problems with force-sensing resistors.  They seem to always be non-monotonic and non-repeating … at more than 10%.  This made calibration impossible. Next we tried making a cute cantilevered under-the-key system for making a 4-piezoelectric sensor.  These were beautiful - sensitive and clean but they needed to be grounded out to have a stable beginning to their excursion.  We made a ground that the piezoelectric devices  would touch when the key was not pressed….Ugh… piezioelectrics have drift when pointing for long, and grounds are not reliable at the tiny signal level they have.  Piezioelectrics are not at all good for DC analog measurement.  I got so mad that I went to Ashok Chandra, my boss, and said I wanted him to spend $500 on a Measurement Systems joystick; one needs a good signal to do anything!  He looked at me gravely, let the moment stretch and then said, \"Get two\". Joe had programmed on the Eniac in the early 1950’s and built many things in his life.  I now easily taught a brilliant Joe with a photographic memory digital electronics. And in a few weeks we had made a circuit that put out mouse quadrature signals. Joe learned Basic easily.  We did the really important piece; we built a human factors testing maze that ran on a discarded PC.  The maze was of 16 characters all over the screen, some short distances, some long, to see how the joystick worked with Fitt’s law… Oops! I had thought that placing the joystick in the keyboard was the hard part - making it point well was harder.  Hmmm, somehow it was hard to control; we fiddled with feedback resistors and capacitors trying to create transfer functions to make good pointing… yuk… So now we decided to tear off the signal conditioning stuff on the prototype boards and go into an A/D board in the PC.  This was the next cool thing. We tried various transfer functions:  linear, S curve, but found it confusing.  So now we built a graphical interface for designing a transfer function that went through arbitrarily drawn places in the force-to-velocity space.  Just like others’ joystick experiences, it skated over the material but when you wanted to stop you couldn’t. It would overshoot and you had to move it slowly back to where you meant to stop. Why did you have to go past something you were selecting, stop and backtrack? We read about overshoot in joysticks. People had theories that it was the fact that rate control was the derivative of position that made position control superior.  We fiddled and fiddled - after a short time though we discovered a weird thing.  We made a transfer function for the pointing stick that hurt your finger but could make selections 25% faster than any reported joystick ever.  Grrr-  it hurt and there was a dent in my finger when I used it.   Why was it faster when I pressed with 5 kg of force (thank you Measurement Systems for a sturdy sensitive sensor)?  Now Joe and I were having fun.  Gosh, we even got a 6-foot wide office to turn into our lab. At first I thought that this magnificent improvement in selection speed was due to the increased dynamic range of muscles for force control.   It felt so much like two actions, a coarse motion and a fine motion, that I even looked to no avail for literature about different kinds of muscular control. We made a program to test finger force control.  The idea was a circle on the screen representing X and Y force space that you had to hold a cursor within.  The force space made the cursor feel like it was on spring so you had to press a certain hardness to get it to the circle.  The circle size represented your stability and its position on the screen represented how much pressure you had to apply. Wow was this weird… we discovered you could only hold the finger in the circle with like 5 or so bits of resolution. Gosh, so little control. And wow, the force control didn’t get much better beyond 8 oz of pressure.  We drafted a paper, and it got rejected from CHI… sigh… We were too busy to deal with it.  So we hummed and hawed and decided that the pain stopped you from pressing the cursor to go faster than you could control it.  Eureka, by making a transfer function that didn’t go fast we could make selections 25% faster than the literature reported with a light touch that didn’t hurt!  We called this the eye tracking speed, though we never took the time to get eye tracking equipment for this project to measure a person’s ballistic eye motions.  We were happy, so we tried others using it.  Yes, users were faster at making selections, but they didn’t like the sluggishness.  So we added a steep  \"turbo charge\" gain segment to the transfer function where you press hard to make the cursor goes super-fast. This didn’t change the data but made the users happy.  We didn’t know why. Many months later, when we were using it in Window applications (on my lovely 3645 Lisp machine) I finally realized that the \"turbo charge\" part allowed me to toss the cursor across the screen …to change window context. Fine motion was also a concern, and we went back to our 5 bit force resolution result and thought that  if you don’t have much control at slow speeds then tremor would increase inaccuracy and maybe a constant speed would be easier to stop on a dime with…. Sure enough a constant speed selection gave a 15% improvement over controllable slow speed in activities like single pixel selection. Before any of this worked, somehow the inventor of RISC, John Cock came to hear about our input device. He liked it- but then, a few weeks later he had a stroke.  Abe Peled, VP of IBM computer science research, went to see him.  When asked what he wanted, John surprised the visitor by stating  \"I want one of Ted’s pointing devices so I can use my computer in bed.\" Luckily it was now working well enough for a good demo.   James McGroddy (soon to be General Manager of research) came to see what we had done.   Sadly, the pointing device was not packaged to send to the hospital and work on someone’s computer yet.  But now people were interested.  Ashok ordered us to be extravagant and make John Cock and 96 other interesting people hand-made pointing stick adorned keyboards.  At this time, IBM made me abandon my patent as terms of continued work on my device and on my research and thesis about adaptive help… it was a difficult moment and an exciting one. We wanted to get the PC Company to see our in-keyboard pointing device. To get it to really work in a keyboard was complicated.  We had to replace the large Measurement System’s joystick package. We bought the silicon strain gauges used in the fancy joysticks but it took us a month to learn how to mount them.  Picking up one of these expensive silicon gauges by its gold leads broke it.  I borrowed an X/Y/Z stage from the microscopy guys.  It was so difficult to manipulate the tiny thing under a microscope. Finally I had the idea of pressing a piece of clay into the sensor holder to pick it up.  At that point the clay mounted to the desk and pressing it close to the sensor moved it towards a strain beam it could be mounted on.  Pressing the lump near the desk moved it very, very little...  When the strain gauge was in place, the superglue came out.  Others at IBM research started using our micromanipulation technique. The PC division had us show the device to the people making a laptop; they couldn’t be convinced it was necessary or would be reliable.  We showed it to a bank- the bank wrote a letter stating that using this would save them on the real-estate needed in an office to leave mouse pads at the clerks’ counters- they would buy $40,000,000 worth of IBM PCs if the company would sell them PCs with the pointing stick in it.  The PC Company declined.  I showed the pointing stick to the design team in Armonk- one Richard Saper gave me 1 minute, he tried to draw a circle - we had optimized for text editing - he said it can’t draw a circle and walked out… We learned to stop optimizing for text editing and Saper became an important supporter and even chose the color red for what would be called the TrackPoint. We always hoped that a driver would make the cursors optimize for the purposes they needed the cursor for- this hasn’t happened yet. We finally got so frustrated that I told the PC division that if they didn’t use it I would publish in 6 months.  I reminded them of my \"bet my badge\" deadline as the time approached.    At the last moment, the lawyer relented and helped me submit the paperwork correctly As soon as we showed the device in Cambridge, England at Interact it was obvious it was a great hit. The crowd was relentless and enthusiastic.  One Jim Lewis from IBM Boca Raton was there.  He went home and told his boss Bob Lawton that they should consider this device for the L40SX computer.  We were invited to PC land again.  This time we were told that it would go into the product. Jim Lewis ran excellent experiments.  The Entry Systems Technology group was responsible for testing out new stuff. They had a code name for the project, \"Castaway\", and that’s what they tried to do.  To bolster confidence in our judgment, human factors experiments were run in Austin, Boca, Lexington, and Yamato.  It was a circus.  I remember the way the PC division was- I would set up meetings with everyone, they would be 1 mile from each other in a pentagon-shaped building, we would run from Testani’s to Condon’s office, to Lawton’s to Lewis’ … no one joined each other’s meetings so they could say different things and I would try to work on the constellation of comments they made.   The people in Austin, Lexington, and Boca seemed disorganized around our innovation.  As soon as the product was accepted by Toshiuki Ikeda of Yamato team, they asked me \"Do we have to pay this ½ million to have EST do all these things?\"  It could have cost the product - I looked at the list of things that had to be done to productize Castaway- only I and Joe and Bob Olyha knew how to do them and most were actually already completed….   \"Please work with us,\" I said.   I was vocal and in the end I may have been the reason that the people causing friction for new technology in EST were disbanded the following year. The process of getting the pointing device into the Yamato project was the end of a lot of stories I won’t enumerate here … more difficult demonstrations and meetings and pressure from the top IBM brass, more help from the bottom, more obstacles everywhere.   The distinguishing feature, however was the team approach to decisions and execution throughout the IBM Japan culture, a direct contrast to the processes we had encountered in the US IBM PC groups in the early 1990s. We went to Yamato, the first time I had been in Japan.  Ashok Chandra sat me down to help me integrate the data from seemly inconsistent experiments done at various labs in the world. The night before the presentation, we fit it together in its final form: the reason people had conflicting data was that the Yorktown experiments tested hours and weeks of use, Boca Raton measured 15 minutes of use and the Yamato data measured the first minute of use of the new device.  Yamada-san stood up and gave a 45 minute talk about one cell on the learning curve matrix, the only one that showed the pointing stick being worse than a trackpad or trackball, for  the first 15 selections.  I got up and pointed out to everyone’s amazement that while the Japanese’s data was the most carefully taken and cleanest ever produced, it all represented a user’s first experience only:  this was news to the Japan team.  Yamada had been working with Alps on a trackball that he was fond of.  Still, Yamada agreed with me to everyone’s amazement.   Our work showing how the different experiments corresponded to different parts of a learning curve was the hit that mattered.  But then everyone agreed that the first few seconds of use might be the most important part of selling a product.  Unlike the American decision process, everyone in that meeting went to the next level up meeting and we were required (in an embarrassing show) to repeat our conflicting talks again.  This happened to an even larger crowd by afternoon including everyone that had been in the other two meetings. It included everyone agreeing to what had been said, allowing consensus.  Yamada had been encouraging us to introduce motion in our isometric joystick.  We had believed there was no space between keys for such motion.  We built one for him anyway that bent and brought it to Japan.  We had experimented with many shaped tops; we had convinced ourselves that a cup-shaped top (much like one that comes with a ThinkPad today but much smaller) would hold the finger with its edges. Product manager and man with deep insight Ikeda and top engineer Arisama Naito both hated the way it felt- Ikeada pushed down hard and showed me how it left a dent in his finger. We had one week to fix the first experience problem and the feeling.  The fourth level manager Kasuaga-san stared me in the eye after we met with Mito the general manager of IBM Asia Pacific and got the go-ahead… he said now we put it in the product you must make it work.  It was one of the scariest moments ever. We included Yamada as tour guide and judge.  We needed his interest and buy in to at least not be against anything besides the trackball.  He pushed us to do better work than we thought we could.  We went to Toyku Hands where I bought styrofoam, sandpaper, cork, sorbothane, rubber, etc.  We went to a ping pong shop- we went everywhere with me and my rechargeable dremel making Trackpoint tops… After several days and many dozen tops, we had a top that was gooey enough to not slip, gooshed enough to hold the finger, and bent enough to give a novice proprioceptive feedback… that improved the first 15 selections by at least 15%, enough to match the pointing speed of a trackpad or trackball. This I hate to say was the beginning of a 9 month long list of tiny successes. Yamato assigned a Michio Suzuki full-time to report to us the bugs he found with programs … and he found problems daily for months.  Bob Olyha worked on circuitry- improving everything about stability and calibration and many other things. The rubber I specified, a 55 durometer post with a 145 mm top made of 1.5mm gushy stalks and a 1 mm low durometer latex top, did not make the IBM Rubber Center of Competence happy. They said it wasn’t FDA approved… my father pointed out that condoms are made of latex…. He had worked at the Bureau of Standards on rubber design during \"the War\"- I hired him to eliminate the plastic-filled-with-rubber top that would have killed the product; it was over Ikeda’s dead body that I spent $20k on a tool to make my father’s beautiful rubber top- the Portland company got screwed as we used the Japanese partner of IBM to make the tops…the tops were not ready for production when the product shipped, I was adamant that the new tops were necessary… Within a week all the plastic tops in the field began breaking… they got slippery and then would require many times an ergonomically reasonable pressure to function… My father’s tops were ready as the problem emerged in customers’ hands. No one cared that they were expensive. While my father knew that the tops were going into product, he never got to see it, as he died that week. I challenged myself to cost reduce the device by one third each year and improve the product.  At first it was special needs buttons that were more comfortable and locked, eliminating the long small signal kapton wires, integrating the post with the circuit board, inventing a new kind of A/D to eliminate a high noise chip, inventing more grippy tops that wore better and cost less, inventing a 3-D sensing post, incorporating invention of \"negative \" inertia that I worked with Rob Barrett to create, integrating work from multiple pointing stick experiments, adding and press to select- all made it better.  A mouse communication language allowed more control from the driver.  Better manufacturing processes and jigs simplified the product too.  An in-plane joystick invention made the post more robust in several ways.   An integrated mechanical fuse that I worked with Barton Smith and Todd Wyant to create that reset automatically was fun to design too. Each of these features is a story in itself.  Steve Ihde put numerous improvements into the drivers all the time. All the sticks ‘til recently shipped with an algorithm that made it so a collaborator using another pointing device plugged into the keyboard would have conversational (1/3 second) pause needed to take the pointer away from the current driver of the UI.  This was hugely helpful for collaboration.  We shipped a teaching screen saver on OS/2 that showed how to use it and how to use the buttons. The ones that got away are more poignant. I designed adaptive algorithms we were exploring- we were able to raise the tracking plateau by 50% for some people, and if we had had the go ahead we could have made that stable and increased performance tremendously.  It seems some people used tendon flex to improve pointing- we found this looked like overshoot and we had trouble making the adaptive algorithms stable in the time box we gave it.  We made a special application that was a game people played to improve their pointing -as their game play improved the transfer function improved too!  We made a surgical tool that used a Trackpoint to allow tremor-free use of a camera from a laparoscope.  We made a selector for the FAA to do ground traffic control that saved a multi hundred-million-dollar contract for IBM with the government.  I would have loved the product to change cursor movement approach for form filling, text editing and graphical applications; again that could probably double performance. Yes, I still want to do it NOW.  We built a gesture language into the Trackpoint that can be accessed in the firmware; the only aspect the driver exposes is Press to Magnify or Press to Select.  We created probably two dozen haptic feedback Trackpoint designs.  They improved novice performance and were loved by the special needs community.  I did a preliminary study that showed how novices selected faster with it; the product group saw no need to spend the money for that.  We made a science experimental test bed to teach physics that never shipped; we made many versions of multi-Trackpoint keyboards that never shipped.  We made many other things too- a versatile pointing device for the table called Russian tea mouse allowed for full hand, thumb, finger, or in-the-palm use.  We made pen like stalks that allowed selection without taking hands off the keyboard.  We made devices that used one set of sensors to run two input devices. We made an electormechanical design used by one special user.  We found that brushing the top instead of pressing it could give amazing dynamic range, at the expense of having to cycle the finger for long selections. The joystick for this had no dead band, it had an exquisite sensitivity and control … we never made an in-keyboard device that shipped with this alternative set of algorithms and scenario.  I designed better grippy top ideas that never made it; also better sensitivity solutions that never made it too.  And I hate to say it but there are many other improvements that I made or would like to make that I could elaborate further on but will stop here….. Simple, eh?

It was released in 1984, along with a wireless keyboard, as part of a desktop computer made by a spin-off of Xerox PARC.  Both keyboard (see separate entry) and mouse used infra-red (IR) light to achieve wireless connectivity.  The one challenge with this was that it required line-of-sight between the device and the receiver in order to work.  Hence, occluding hands, coffee-cups, etc. could disrupt connectivity.",
        "buxton_notes": "To come From https://www.itespresso.de/2015/11/11/swiftpoint-bringt-computermaus-mit-touchscreen-funktion/?pid=4280 Logitech entwickelte 1984 im Rahmen eines OEM-Projektes für die Firma Metaphor die erste kabellose Maus. Zur Übertragung wurde Infrarot genutzt, die Übertragungsgeschwindigkeit blieb deutlich hinter der von kabelgebundenen Mäusen zurück (Bild: Logitech). Logitech developed the first wireless mouse in 1984 as part of an OEM project for Metaphor. Infrared was used for transmission, the transmission speed was significantly lower than that of wired mice (Picture: Logitech). Also: Logitech designs the world's first cordless mouse as part of the obscure Metaphor computer system. The battery-powered mouse uses infrared light (like a TV remote control) to communicate with a base receiver unit. Various companies try a similar IR technique over the years, but it never takes off. Computer World: https://www.computerworld.com/article/2529718/the-computer-mouse-turns-40.html From e-bay \"about\" Metaphor Computer System - Keyboard and mouse Keyboard: Model 113 ML1, serial number 8704-00579, assembly number 97-0103-02 Wireless two-button mouse: Model 110, serial number 8741-03210, assembly number 97-0102-01 Metaphor Computer Systems (1982-1994) was a Xerox PARC spin-off that created an advanced workstation, database gateway, a unique graphical office interface, and software applications that communicate.  The Metaphor machine was one of the first commercial workstations to offer a complete hardware/software package and a GUI.  Although the company achieved some commercial success, it never achieved the fame of either the Apple Macintosh or Microsoft Windows. Hardware The Metaphor workstation had a wireless keyboard, wireless mouse, wireless numeric pad, and a wireless 5-function keypad. All these input devices docked in the desktop workstation where they were recharged. Objects on the desktop and open applications had a uniform command set that could be controlled by the keypad which had Copy, Move, Delete, Options, and Size. Workstations were connected with Ethernet. The industrial design of the workstation was done by Mike Nuttall of Matrix Product Design. It won a gold medal from the IDSA. The workstation itself was engineered by James Yurchenco at David Kelley Design. Both Matrix and David Kelley Design were precursors of IDEO. Two different workstations models were produced. Workstation One had an external electronics enclosure. Workstation Two had integrated electronics. A Workstation Three, which included a color screen, was designed through final prototypes, but was never taken into production. GUI Origins Xerox PARC in 1973 began development of the Alto, widely shown in 1979. The Alto was the first computer with a bitmap display, mouse and a desktop metaphor as a graphical user interface (GUI). Xerox commercialized it as the Xerox Star. DIS The Metaphor GUI provided a unique visualization of end-to-end elements in an enterprise. In total, Metaphor branded this as a Data Interpretation System (DIS), which is a class of Decision Support System (DSS) The DIS software was designed to show in one workflow, the access of data from SQL databases, its analysis and then its presentation. This was accomplished by using graphically iconic applications for database gateway, spreadsheet, plot, email, and printing tools all connected by arrows. These were animated when the workflow ran. The workflow collection was called a Capsule",

It was also the first clam-shell laptop with an integrated trackball which could serve as a mouse alternative.

It also supported the Apple Desktop Bus (a predecessor to USB), which enabled other input devices, such as mice to be easily connected.

        "buxton_notes": "This was the first battery-powered Macintosh.  It was the first clam-shell laptop with an integrated trackball as a mouse alternative.  The trackball could be placed to either the left or right of the keyboard to accommodate handedness.  The very first models, of which this is one, had an active matrix display, which was wonderful for its time in terms of responsiveness and sharpness.  However, it did not have back lighting.  That is, like paper and e-ink displays, to be read, an external light source such as the sun or lamp was required.  On the positive side, the battery life was extended due to the reduced power consumption. While, at the time, one could get away calling this a portable.  In today’s lingo however, weighing in at 7.26 kg / 16 lbs., this machine would now be deemed a \"luggable.\"  Fact is, I knew that at the time that it came out.  But at the time that I got it, I was working with Mark Weiser’s Ubiquitous Computing team, and understood Moore’s law.  That is, I knew that the weight and size were going to rapidly drop, and that change was going to be significant in terms of how computers - namely portable computers - were used.  Hence, despite appearances (and reality) I treated this machine as if it was a modern lightweight portable and carried it with me everywhere for at least a year.  Office-to-office, up-and-down the PARC hallways, etc.  There is a reason that I have really long arms for my body size! My use of this machine was a great example of one of my maxims, namely: The only way to engineer the future tomorrow is to have lived in it yesterday. The more I carried it, the more used to doing so I got, so the size and weight disappeared.  And given that wifi was not commonplace at the time, having my digital stuff always with me on my own machined produced a valuable visceral sense of knowing in advance many implications of what was inevitably to come. That is the kind of attitude which drove most a PARC.  It was part of the culture.  And it goes a long way - coupled with encouraging management and brilliant determined people - to explaining why so much of what came in the next 25 years had roots in that lab.",

        "title": "IBM Convertible Model 5140",
        "short_description": "This is the first IBM laptop computer.  It was also IBM’s first computer which could be run on batteries.  What makes this computer a \"Convertible\" are its most distinguishing features:  it had a portable printer which you could snap on and off, depending on need, which could be run off internal batteries.  As well, the LCD display could snap off and a larger cathode ray tube (CRT) display be plugged in, thereby essentially converting it from a laptop to a desktop PC.",
        "buxton_notes": "The Model 5140 Convertible was the first laptop computer that IBM produced.  IBM had made \"luggable\" computers before, but these were heavy, bulky (kind of like a portable sewing machine in its case) and had to be plugged into the wall to be operated. While heavy by today’s standards, the 5140 Convertible was much more portable than its IBM predecessor, and comparable in size and weight with the 1982 GRiD Compass, whose \"clam shell\" form it followed.  Unlike the GRiD Compass, however, the IBM Convertible could operate off internal batteries, as well as power mains. It was the first IBM computer to be able to do so, as well as to employ 3.5\" floppy disks. However, in both, it was, being preceded by the 1983 Gavllan SC, hence it was not first overall. Besides adopting the general form factor of the GRiD Compass, the design of the Model 5140’s design adopted a feature also introduced by the 1983 Gavilan SC: the ability to snap on/off a purpose-designed printer which could be powered off the laptop’s batteries, thereby converting it from a laptop computer to laptop \"mini office\". The other aspect of the Model 5140’s design which led to it being named \"Convertible\" was the ability which it provided to detach the LCD display and replace it by a larger and more capable cathode ray tube (CRT).  The effect of doing so was to convert the Model 5140 from a portable laptop to a desktop computer. This idea of being able to detach the LCD from the laptop reappeared in 2002 with Microsoft’s introduction of the Tablet PC.  In so doing, it both established the notion of \"convertible\" as a new product category.  This is perhaps best illustrated by Compaq’s 2002 TC1000 Tablet PC.   Like IBM’s 1986 convertible, the Compaq’s LCD could be removed from the base.  However, in this case, the actual computer came with it, and it was the keyboard, etc. which was left behind.  Hence, unlike the earlier IBM, it was the removed LCD which remained functional, converted into a pen-based tablet, or slate, computer.  The Compaq took the notion of \"convertible\" even further and is therefore well worth seeking it out in the collection.",

Text entered can be exchanged between it and a computer via a connecting cable.  When connected, the six-button keyboard can be configured to be used as an alternative keyboard for the connected computer.",
        "buxton_notes": "This Microwriter is one of my favourite things in the collection. It is the one that I have had the longest and has had the most use.  My use of it taught me a great deal about the relationship between design and nature of human skill - lessons which would have been much more difficult to learn from the  literature alone and which have stood me in good stead ever since. The Microwriter was, I believe, the world’s first hand-held portable digital word processor.  It was first shown in 1978. This unit dates from 1982. One types with a 6-button one-handed chording keyboard. That is, your fingers are always in \"home position\" (the thumb being the only digit to alternate between two keys) and you enter text by pushing combinations of buttons, or \"chords\".  Hence, you could (and I would) stand in the subway, hold on to the ceiling strap for balance with one hand, and type with the other.  I just needed to hold the device against my chest with the palm of the same hand that I typed with.   Yet, when at my desk, the device could also substitute for my regular QWERTY keyboard, thus enabling me to type with one hand, and point/select using the mouse, with the other - thereby significantly reducing the amount of back-and-forth hand movement between mouse and keyboard (at the cost of reduced typing speed). The Microwriter was designed to be operated by the right hand, and it was ergonomically tailored, accordingly.   A version for left hand usage was never released.  Partially, this reflects the bias of a predominantly right-handed world.  It also reflected the economic realities of a small company.  But where this affected me, in particular - even as a right-handed person - was that this right-hand-only decision did not anticipate the bi-manual usage which I described above. Such usage was not anticipated at the time that the Microwriter was being developed.  This is certainly understandable since broad awareness of the mouse did not emerge until the first Apple Macintosh was released in 1984.  The significance here is that in splitting the typing and pointing tasks between the two hands, the predominant tendency is to map the pointing/selection task performed using the mouse to the preferred (or \"dominant\") hand, and the discrete typing task, such as with the Microwriter, to the non-preferred hand.  This is precisely the task-to-hand mapping which Engelbart demonstrated in his 1968 Mother of All Demos. Furthermore, it also explains why - in contrast to the Microwriter’s hand-specific form - Engelbart and English designed a hand-neutral piano-like chord keyboard.  (See the Collection’s Xerox PARC 5-key Chord Keyboard). Overall, this choice - between a one-handed keyboard which was neutral vs specific to which hand is being used - is an excellent example of a persistent trade-off confronting designers: that between the strong-specific vs weak-general.  As we shall see, the impact of such decisions goes much deeper than the device itself. Despite being right-handed, I wanted to be able to use the Microwriter in either hand.  While moble, or using the device on its own, the right-handed form factor was perfect.  In fact, in my opinion, it is unsurpassed over all these years since.  However, in use with a mouse, I very much wanted to type with my left hand - for the reasons stated above.  But here is where the impact of the strong \"right-hand\" conceptualization of the product penetrated well beyond the physical device, to a level where I both helped, but limited learning the chords which enabled one to type With the caveat that I have no solid data to support what I am about to say, in my own personal experience, with the Microwriter, the time taken between opening the box and being able to enter basic text without reference to a manual, was significantly shorter and easier - by far - than any chord keyboard I had seen previously, or since. This was a consequence of both their mapping of chords-to-characters, and the accompanying instructional materials.  Core to this was the use of visual mnemonics to teach the chording scheme.  One can learn to touch type within about 60 minutes (a good thing, since one rapidly discovers that with chord keyboards, there is no hunt-and-peck option; you can either touch type or you can’t type at all). A key aspect of the documentation is illustrated in the figure below. The inverted V arrangement of circles provides a stylized representation of the position of the five digits of the right hand.  The red arrows illustrate the finger-to-key mapping - the five primary Microwriter keys being shown in dark blue. As seen in the examples in the table below, a black dot in the middle of a circle indicates that the button associated with that finger is depressed. The character resulting from that combination of button presses is indicated in red.  Notice that each row illustrates one of three distinct classes of mnemonic. For the letters J and L, the mnemonic reinforces the shape of the letter, with the three fingers involved representing the end points of the lines defining the character. In the case of S, the mnemonic used employs word association.  One is to use the knowledge that one wears one’s Signet ring on the ring finger to remember that the letter S is typed using that one finger. In the case of SPACE and the letter E, yet a different class of mnemonic is exploited, namely, the knowledge that those are the two most common characters in English, and that the thumb and index finger are the most dexterous digits, and that single button actions are simpler and faster to execute than chords.  Hence, the E and SPACE are mapped to single button pushes using those most agile digits. If you consider these three cases carefully, a few interesting and relevant points emerge: Additional Step: Trying to recall the chord for a character often requires a two-step process: first, recalling the class of mnemonic, then the mnemonic within that class. Cultural/Linguistic Biases: There are two such examples. First, compared to a native English speaker from the UK, it is far less likely that one from North America will have any idea what a signet ring is, much less which finger it is worn on.  Second, the dominance of \"e\" over other characters does not necessarily carry over into all languages that employ the Roman alphabet. Inconsistent Hand-to-Hand Mapping:  Knowing why the \"e\" and \"space\" characters are associated with the index finger and thumb, respectively, most likely you will use those same fingers if asked how to enter them with the left hand.  Given the same task for \"s\", you will most likely again use the ring finger. These are mirror image hand-to-hand transfers of the character codes.  On the other hand, consider the same task with the \"J\" and the \"L\" characters. Learning these characters by their shape, rather than by finger association, there is a dilemma.  If the codes are mapped by mirror image, the \"J\" would be entered using the shape of an \"L\", and vice versa.  Hence, because of the spatial-based mnemonic taught, these characters would naturally transfer by spatial congruence, rather than mirror image. The resulting inconsistency presents a built-in glitch for those wanting to apply their existing right hand skills to a left-hand device - something which is enabled by a direct descendent of the Microwriter, also found in the collection:  The CyKey. I am conflicted in all of this because I think that the New User’s Guide is one of the best examples of technical writing that I have ever seen in a user’s manual.  I love how different representations are used in parallel to get messages across.  I appreciated this when I was learning. I also believe that the manual is well worth studying by anyone writing tutorials, even today. As an exercise, I also recommend comparing this manual to those produced for the other chord keyboards in the collection. On the other hand, there is this issue that, in preparing the pedagogical approach, and the associated mental models that would result, they did not anticipate using the device in either or both hands, and thereby inadvertently built in some road-blocks. This is understandable, given that the design was done before the mouse was commercially available, much less the GUI.  But that just signals all the more need for caution and looking further forward in our own decisions - which risk falling into the same trap.  One that - when you move to looking at the Microwriter’s descendent, the CyKey (which is designed to be used by either hand), the Microwriter decisions ran into at full steam. In the larger scheme of things, not a huge problem.  But a problem nevertheless. I still have a softspot for this device, and everything that it represents!",

        "title": "Mouse Systems ProAgio! Scrolling Mouse",
        "short_description": "Based on my research, the ProAgio, released in 1995, was the first commercially available scroll wheel mouse.  It was produced by Kye Systems Corp. of Taiwan and released under two different names. Under the Mouse Systems Brand (which Kye had acquired in 1990), it was released as the ProAgio! Mouse, or Scroll Mouse.  Under the Genius brand, it was called the EasyProAgio. The versions in the collection are from Mouse Systems.",
        "buxton_notes": "The ProAgio mouse was, to the best of my knowledge, the first commercially available scroll-wheel mouse.  That is, a mouse which - beside enabling pointing, selecting, dragging, etc., also incorporated a wheel which - when rolled in one direction or another with one of the fingers or the thumb - enabled a document to be scrolled up or down, or for example, and image to be scaled. Besides incorporating a scroll wheel, the ProAgio had five buttons.  Across the top were the left, middle and right mouse buttons typically found on PC mice.  (Macintosh mice at the time only had one button.) The fourth button was incorporated into the scroll wheel itself.  It was activated by pushing the scroll-wheel down, and scrolling could be performed with the button depressed or not, thereby enabling different scrolling modes.  Finally, running along its left side was the fifth button. This was designed to be operated by the thumb (thereby reflecting a right-hand bias in its industrial design). Clicking this let one cycle through the currently open applications, one click at a time.  Alternatively, while holding the side button, one could scroll through the open applications to select the one desired. While the ProAgio was the first scroll-wheel mouse commercially available, it was not the first to be publicly shown. That distinction belongs to the Apple Scroll Wheel mouse prototype designed by Gina Venolia and shown in 1989. In 2012 Gina built a replica of that first scroll-wheel mouse and donated it to the collection. Hence, here we have yet another example of the \"Long Nose of Innovation.\" There were six years between Venolia’s prototype demonstration and the commercial release of the ProAgio.  And despite the first prototype being developed at Apple, it took them 16 years before they released a mouse with integrated scrolling -  their 2005 Mighty Mouse (which is also in the collection)!",

        "title": "Depraz Swiss Mouse",
        "short_description": "This mouse is one of the first commercially available mice to be sold publicly.  It is known as the Swiss mouse, and yes, the roller mechanism was designed by a Swiss watchmaker.  Coincidentally, the company that made it, Depraz, is based in Apples, Switzerland.  Their success in selling this mouse is what caused Logitech to switch from a software development shop to one of the world’s leading suppliers of mice and other input devices.",
        "buxton_notes": "DePraz began manufacturing in 1980, but following design built in 1979. Logitech started selling it in 1982.  It was one of the first mass produced mice, one of the first available ball mice, as well as to have an optical shaft encoder - thereby improving linearity.  An interesting fact, given its Swiss heritage, is that its designer, André Guignard, was trained as a Swiss watch maker. Unlike most modern mice, the DePraz, or \"Swiss\" mouse had a quasi-hemispherical shape.  Hence, it was held in a so-called \"power-grip\", much as one would grip a horizontally held ball - the thumb and small finger applying pressure on each side, with added support from the weight/friction of the palm on the back of the mouse. In this posture, the three middle fingers naturally positioning themselves over the three buttons mounted at the lower edge of the front. Largely freed of grip pressure, by grace of thumb and little finger, the middle fingers had essentially freedom of motion to independently operate the buttons. Each having a dedicated finger, the buttons could be easily pushed independently or in any combination.  Like the three valves on a trumpet, this ability to \"chord\" extended the three physical buttons to have the power of seven. The down-side of this \"turtle shell\" form factor is that it placed the hand in a posture in which mouse movement relied more of the larger muscle groups of the arm to wrist, rather than wrist to fingers - the latter being the approach taken in most subsequent mice. The original Swiss Mouse was developed at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne by a project led by Jean-Daniel Nicoud, who was also responsible for the development of its optical shaft encoder.  To augment their revenue stream, Logitech, then a software and hardware consulting company for the publishing industry, acquired marketing rights for North America.  Mouse revenue quickly overshadowed that from software.  In 1983, Logitech acquired DePraz, named the Swiss Mouse the \"P4\", and grew to become one of the largest input device manufacturer in the world.  One curious coincidence is that they were founded in the town of Apples, Switzerland.",

As with volume controls, the range of rotation (from minimum to maximum) was finite.  That is, at each extreme there was a hard stop.  Hence, if you moved the mouse too far in any direction, you would hit that rotational boundary, and the mouse would stop sensing any further motion in that direction.  To continue further, you would have to lift the mouse and \"rewind\" the wheel(s) in the opposite direction.  In short, the mouse \"worked\" as proof of concept, but was only just \"workable\".",

        "buxton_notes": "The CadMan is a 6 degree of freedom (DOF) joystick controller.  It represented a significant step towards making this class of is controller more affordable.  It was mainly directed at 3D modelling and animation and was a \"next generation\" of the Magellan/SpaceMouse controller, which is also in the collection. Like the Magellan, this is an isometric rate-control joystick.  That is, it rests in a neutral central position, not sending and signal.  When a force is applied to it, it emits a signal indicating the direction and strength of that force.  This signal can then be mapped to a parameter of a selected object, such as a sphere, and - for example - cause that sphere to rotate for as long as, and as fast as, and in the direction determined by, the duration, force, and direction of the applied force.  When released, it springs back to neutral position.  Note that the force does not need to be directed along a single DOF.  In fact, a core feature of the device is that one can simultaneously and independently apply force that asserts control over more than one DOF, and furthermore, vary those forces dynamically. As an aid to understanding, let me walk through some of the underlying concepts at play here by using a more familiar device: a computer mouse.  If you move a mouse in a forward/backward direction, the mouse pointer on the screen moves between the screen’s top and bottom.  If you think of the screen as a piece of graph paper, that corresponds to moving along the \"Y\" axis.  That is one degree of freedom. On the other hand, you could move the mouse left and right, which causes the mouse to move between the left and right side of the screen.  That would correspond to moving along the graph paper’s \"X\" axis - a second degree of freedom. Yet, you can also move the mouse diagonally.  This is an example of independently controlling two degrees of freedom. Now imagine that if you lifted your mouse off your desktop, that your computer could dynamically sense its height as you did so.  This would constitute a \"flying mouse\" (the literal translation of the German word for a \"Bat\", which Canadian colleague, Colin Ware, applied to just such a mouse which he built in 1988). If you moved your Bat vertically up and down, perpendicular to the desktop, you would be controlling movement along the \"Z\" axis - a third degree of freedom. Having already seen that we can move a mouse diagonally, we have established that we need not be constrained to only moving along a single axis.  That extends to the movement of our Bat and movement along the \"Z\" axis. We can control our hand movement in dependently in any or all directions in 3D space. But how does one reconcile the fact that we call the CadMan a \"3D controller, and yet also describe it as having 6 degrees of freedom?  After all, the example this far demonstrates that our Bat, as described thus far, has freedom on movement in 3 Dimensions.  While true, we can extend our example to prove that that freedom to move in 3D is also highly constrained. To demonstrate this, move your hand in 3D space on and above your desktop.  However, do so keeping your palm flat, parallel to the desktop with your fingers pointing directly forward.  In so doing, you are still moving in 3D. Now, while moving, twist your wrist, while moving the hand, such that your palm is alternatively exposed to the left and right side.  This constitutes rotation around the \"Y\" axis.  A fourth DOF.  Now add a waving motion to your hand, as if it were a paper airplane diving up and down, while also rocking left and right.  But keep your fingers pointing forward.  You have now added a fifth DOF, rotation around the \"X\" axis.  Finally, add a twist to your wrist so that your fingers are no longer constrained to pointing forward.  This is the sixth degree of freedom, rotation around the \"Z\" axis. Now don’t be fooled, this exercise could continue.  We are not restricted to even six DOF.  Imagine doing the above, but where the movement and rotations are measured relative to the Bat’s position and orientation, rather than to the holding/controlling hand, per se. One could imagine the Bat having a scroll wheel, like the one on most mice today.  Furthermore, while flying your Bat around in 3D, that wheel could easily be rolled in either forward or backward, and thereby control the size of whatever was being controlled.  Hence, with one hand we could assert simultaneous and independent control over 7 DOF in 3D space. This exercise has two intended take-aways.  The first is a better working understanding between the notion of Degree of Freedom (DOF) and Dimension in space. Hopefully, the confusion frequently encountered when 3D and 6DOF are used in close context, can now be eliminated.  Second, is that, with appropriate sensing, the human hand is capable of exercising control over far more degrees of freedom that six.  And if we use the two hands together, the potential number of DOF that one can control goes even further. Finally, it is important to add one more take-away - one which both emerges from, and is frequently encountered when discussing, the previous two.  That is, do not equate exercising simultaneous control over a high number of DOF with consciously doing the same number of different things all at once.  The example that used to be thrown at me when I started talking about coordinated simultaneously bi-manual action went along the lines of, \"Psychology tells us that we cannot do multiple things at once, for example, simultaneously tapping your head and  rubbing your stomach.\" Well, first, I can tap my head with one hand while rubbing my stomach with the other.  But that is not the point.  The whole essence of skill - motor-sensory and cognitive - is \"chunking\" or task integration.  When one appears to be doing many different things at once, if they are skilled, they are consciously doing only one thing.  Playing a chord on the piano, for example, or skiing down the hill.  Likewise, in flying your imaginary BAT in the previous exercise with the scroll wheel, were you doing 7 things at once, or one thing with 7 DOF?  And if you had a Bat in each hand, does that mean you are now doing 14 things at once, or are you doing one thing with 14 DOF?  Let me provide a different way of answering this question:  if you have ever played air guitar, or \"conducted\" the orchestra that  you are listening to on the radio, you are exercising control over more than 14 DOF.  And you are doing exactly what I just said, \"playing air guitar\" or \"conducting an orchestra\".  One thing - at the conscious level, which is what matters - despite almost any one thing being able to be deconstructed into hundreds of sub-tasks.  As I said the essence of skill: aggregation, or chunking. What is most important for both tool designers and users to be mindful of, is the overwhelming influence that our choice and design of tools impacts the degree to which such integration or chunking can take place.  The degree to which the tool matches both the skills that we have already acquired through a lifetime of living in the everyday world, and the demands of the intended task, the more seamless that task can be performed, the more \"natural\" it will feel, and the less learning will be required. In my experience, it brought particular value when used bimanually, in combination with a mouse, where the preferred hand performed conventional pointing, selection and dragging tasks, while the non-preferred hand could manipulate the parameters of the thing being selected. First variation of the since the 2001 formation of 3Dconnextion. The CadMan came in 5 colours:  smoke, orange, red, blue and green. See the notes for the LogiCad3D Magellan for more details on this class of device.  It is the \"parent\" of the CadMan, and despite the change in company name, it comes from the same team.",

It was also one of the first PDA devices, preceding the Palm Pilot, by 3 years.",

First revealed (as opposed to shipped) in 1993, and certainly the first legitimate \"smartphone\", it was very much the synthesis of some key prior work. For example, its debut took place 20 years after Martin Cooper of Motorola demonstrated the first wireless cellular phone - the 1983 Motorola DynaTAC 8000X.  It was that same year, 1983, that the first device which crossed the line from portable calculator to \"personal digital assistant\" (PDA) was released: the Casio-PF-3000.  Finally, the Apple iPhone was not released until 2007.  The elapsed time being 37 years That is Put long description from web page here (note - most pages only have short description) The February 1994 issue of Byte Magazine (p. 24) named Simon Best of Show as well as Best Portable Awards for Comdex 1994.

        "buxton_notes": "The first digital camera that I used was the Apple Quicktake 100, which was released in 1994.  I have no idea where that camera ended up.  My second digital camera was this one, my Nikon Coolpix 100.  This was released in 1997, and I got it as soon as it came out.  While not as high resolution as the Quicktake 100 (512 x 480 vs 640 x 480), the convenience, size and simplicity of the camera really appealed to me - and in many ways, still does. One of the main reasons is that it is self-contained.  It is the only digital camera that I have had for which I didn’t have to carry around extra cables to connect it to my computer, or power supplied with which to recharge the batteries.  While not small by today’s standards, it nevertheless  fit in my briefcase or pocket and was there to use.  And, because it had an integrated PCMCIA card, one just slid it into the card slot on one’s computer and the images were immediately accessible.  In so doing, it introduced many of the characteristics that made the more recent ill-fated Flip video camera so appealing. Yes, it only had .3 megapixel images, and had no zoom, no LCD to review images taken, was expensive, and only held 19 full-resolution images.  But it was also 1997.  It was great for the time - and given that my briefcase today has more than 4 times this camera’s volume in cables and power supplies for the various gadgets that I \"must have\" with me to do my job, I wish that some of the attributes of this camera (cables and power supplies) were more prevalent today! Excerpt from a Review PC Pro magazine, October 1997 Leaving aside the vagaries of PC Card, the Nikon CoolPix couldn't be much easier to use, both to take pictures and to get them into your PC (provided you have a PC Card). As with all cameras in this price range, the resolution means any images printed in sizes much above 5 « 3in are going to show their digital origins. Some compression artifacts are visible, as is the dither pattern, but for newsletters and Web sites the Nikon provides good results with excellent build quality and ease of use, all at a good price. Nikon is marketing the CoolPix as a computer peripheral and not as a camera. Image quality for holiday snapshot-size prints won't match a half-decent compact camera at a fraction of the cost. You're paying for the ease and convenience of digital photography and, if the resolution and PC Card limitations of the CoolPix suit your needs, it's a worthwhile product.

The question was to determine how well doing so would enable a user, with the same hand and device, to control both the pointing/selection tasks normally associated with a mouse, with other (up to) 2-dimensional tasks such as horizontal and vertical scrolling documents.   The touchpad used could only sense a single-touch, and it also served as the mouse button(s).",
        "buxton_notes": "The Pad Mouse is an experimental mouse built to explore the potential of adding a touch pad to a mouse.  It was developed jointly at Alias|Wavefront and the University of Toronto. The question which motivated the work was how well doing so would enable a user, with the same hand and device, to control both the pointing/selection tasks normally associated with a mouse, with other (up to) 2-dimensional tasks such as horizontal and vertical scrolling documents? While the first mouse was developed at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) in 1965 by Doug Engelbart and Bill English, that mouse was basic, to say the least.  First, it sensed position by way of the movement of two wheels protruding from the bottom, positioned at right angles to each other.  One rolled one way or the other according to horizontal movement, and the other according to vertical movement.  The axle of each wheel was a potentiometer, not a shaft encoder.  That means that each could rotate only a certain amount in either direction before it reached its rotational limit.  The potentiometers used could rotate multiple times so as to reduce the incidences of hitting the limits of rotation; however, this remained an issue, nevertheless. For the next few years, most development in mouse design had to do with improving the form factor to better fit the hand, the number, placement and function of buttons, and especially, the means of sensing motion. It was only in 1985 that mice incorporating additional types of controls began to be disclosed.  The first was the Mighty Mouse, a mouse developed jointly by NTT Labs in Japan and ETAH Zurich.  It had 5 keys (two of which could also function as 1 degree of freedom joysticks) as well as a thumb-operated wheel controller.  Unfortunately, there is not one in the collection.  However, this trend continued, and the collection includes a number of key steps in the evolution which followed, including: 1989: The Apple Computer Scroll-Wheel Mouse Prototype, the first scroll-wheel mouse. 1992: The Prohance PowerMouse with a full numerical keypad 1995: The Mouse Systems ProAgio! Scrolling Mouse, the first commercially available scroll-wheel mouse ~1997: The Small Talk Mouse Phone: The first mouse to incorporate a telephone, including dial-pad, microphone and speaker. 1997: The IBM ScrollPoint Mouse: The first mouse to incorporate a joystick which supported both horizontal and vertical scrolling It is out of this evolutionary sequence that the PadMouse (and the ScrollPad Mouse) emerged.  A sequence that continued  to evolve, as can be seen with other mice in the collection. Since today we are used to multi-touch sensing, one thing to note about both of these touch mice is that they  could only sense a single-touch, and with the PadMouse, the touch pad also performed the task of the mouse button(s). The development of the PadMouse, and the research undertaken with it is described in the accompanying 1998 paper by Balakrishnan and Patel.  It is both an interesting and useful exercise to compare the approach taken with this mouse, and the independently developed Fujitsu Takamisawa ScrollPad Mouse, also in the collection.  Released in the same year that the PadMouse paper was published, the ScrollPad mouse was the first commercially available touch pad mouse.",

Nevertheless, it still disrupted the market by selling at 20% of the price of the cheapest competitor.  By so doing, it made this new kind of gadget affordable to the more general population, rather than just the well-heeled.",
        "buxton_notes": "The original Casio-Mini is important because of the disruptive effect it had on the young pocket-sized portable calculator market.  When this first version was released in August 1972, its purchase price was just 20% of its nearest priced competitor. To place this in context, in 1971 a company called Busicom released the first battery-powered pocket-sized electronic calculator:  the Busicom LE-120A Handy LE. Its small size was enabled by the recent release of technology capable of placing the functionality of a 4-function calculator on a single chip (integrated circuit), rather than requiring much bulkier discrete components, (logic, transistors, etc.) previously needed to realize the same functionality.  The Busicom LE-120A Handy LE was also the first pocket-sized calculator to use an LED display. Its price was $395.00, which was out of reach of all but the very well heeled. In February 1972, Busicom released a less expensive version, the LE-120S Handy. This was in a plastic, rather than metal, case; however, the reduced price of $295.00 was still high for the average businessperson, much less consumer. This was the situation when, six months later, August 1972, Casio released its Mini Electronic Calculator. Like the Busicom models, the Casio-Mini was a 4-function calculator. That is, all any of them could do was add, subtract, multiply, and divide. However, the Casio-Mini could only give results to the nearest integer. In contrast, the Busicom Handy models, had two significant digits to the right of the decimal. Furthermore, the Casio-Mini was about 1/3 larger than them.  Yet, despite these two disadvantages, the Casio-Mini took off and both transformed and dominated the market. What this clearly established was that an 80% price differential was enough to compensate for a few shortcomings of a product. The impact of the Casio-Mini was dramatic. Only companies who could survive in this emerging market were those who had the efficiencies or long-term funding to match or exceed the price/performance bar set by Casio.  The result was that the number of players in the market was significantly reduced, and those who remained had to significantly up both their game in terms of both efficiency and innovation. One of the companies which did not survive the disruption was Busicom.",

        "buxton_notes": "The 1958 Braun T3 transistor radio is a classic of the international design style prevalent in the mid-20th century.  By its sparse clean lines, it shares characteristics of the style seen in another familiar example, the font Helvetic, which was designed the previous year. The T3 was designed by Dieter Rams, recruited by Braun in 1955, in collaboration with the Ulm Hochschüle fur Gestaltun.. Its design language had a strong influence on that of the original Apple iPod Classic.  The connection is made more obvious if one views the radio rotated 90° clockwise, as in one of the accompanying photographs.  Here one can easily see the the similarity of proportions, uniformity of colour, angle of corners, location of display (audio versus visual), and the use of a flush rotary wheel controller.",

        "buxton_notes": "Released in 1939, the Mystery Control was the world’s first commercially available wireless remote control for home entertainment.  Its primary purpose was to permit you to control your radio from wherever you were sitting, without being encumbered by a connecting wire between and the radio.

If the unit being controlled also incorporated a record player, the Mystery Control could also  let you switch between it and the radio, as well as stop playing the current record, and drop the next one stacked on the spindle to play. Viewed with today’s eyes, what most stands out about the Mystery Controller is its size - it is much larger than any remote that I had ever seen previously - and the fact that it used what appears to be a telephone dial as the means to interact with it.  This latter was surprising to me, and I suspect even more-so to later generations who did not grow up with dial phones. The easiest way to explain this today is be analogy.  The Mystery Controller uses a phone dial as the controller for the same reason that after the Apple iPhone was released in 2007, every new gadget seemed to have to have a touch screen for control.  In short, for both cases, it was cool. In the case of the 1939 Mystery Control, the iconic product which made the phone dial cool was the 1937 launch of the Western Electric 302 telephone, designed by Henry Dreyfuss (which is in the collection)  Dial telephones were not new.  Western Electric began deploying them in 1919, which is when the launched the 50AL \"Candlestick\" Dial Phone (also in the collection).  Even before that, dial phones had been deployed for over 20 years in smaller private exchanges. So if Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas A. Watson made their famous telephone call in 1876, dial phones started to appear in the 1890s, and Western Electric started to deploy them in 1919, why was the 302 telephone a big deal in 1937, 60 years after Bell and Watson’s call, and 18 years after the Western Electric AL Candlestick dial phone? The simple answer is, infrastructure.  A dial phone is of no value if there is not a network capable of decoding the signals from the caller’s dial such that all of the switches along the way are automatically set to route the call to the intended recipient’s phone.  The bigger the network the longer this takes.  And once automated switches are in place, phones need to be deployed, users need to learn how to operate them, and service people need to be trained to service them. Furthermore, to make things take even longer, one must take into account that 1930 signaled the beginning of the great depression.  Few could afford phones, even if they were available, and they weren’t available as the financial resources to deploy the infrastructure were less than plentiful. And finally, while the 50AL Candlestick phone was good for its time, its time was rapidly passing, and the introduction of the 302 telephone made a significant difference.  The main one was that it was the first self-contained integrated phone.  Yes, the Candlestick phones look wonderful, but they are only the microphone, speaker and dial.  The electronic guts of the phone are in a completely separate box screwed to the wall somewhere.  With the 302, the who thing was in one package which could be easily unplugged from one location and plugged in at another. In short, it took until after 1937 for automated telephone exchanges and dial phones to start to approach critical mass.  But there was still a long way to go.  If you search on-line, you can easily find television instructional videos from the 1950s which teach how to dial a phone! So yes, as archaic and arcane as the Mystery Controller appears today, it reflected the coolness of the emerging modern future emerging out of the depression.

        "buxton_notes": "This 1989 Motoroloa DynaTAC 8000X is a later version of the first commercially available portable hand-held cellular phone to get FCC approval in the USA - the 1983 Motorola DynaTAC 8000X.  From the perspective of form-factor and function, the two phones are pretty much identical. The model 8000M is a good representative of the first \"feature\" (as opposed to \"smart\") mobile phones. The name \"DynatAC\" is an acronym for \"Dynamic Adaptive Total Area Coverage.\"  This is technospeak for the properties which a cell phone introduced.  Dynamic meant that you could move around, and total area coverage meant that your movement would not be limited.  Unlike radio stations which fade out as you drive away from the transmitter, cell phones were, in principle, always in range of a transceiver (a combination of a transmitter and a receiver, thus enabling two-way communication rather than just broadcasting, as in AM or FM radio stations). This ability to always be in range was based on the idea of using many small transceivers, spread across the territory, rather than one big one. These small transceivers were ideally evenly spread around the territory in overlapping pattern, or \"cells\" (hence the name), so that as you approached the range boundary of one cell, you were already entering into the range of a neighboring one.  The \"magic\" came from the ability of the underlying system to seamlessly hand-off your call from one transceiver to another as you moved through the territory. But why not use fewer big transceivers rather than many smaller ones?  The answer lies in the limited capacity of the transceivers.  They could only handle so many calls at once.  For sake of explaining the point, imagine that all transceivers have the same call capacity, regardless of the range of their coverage.  Then assuming the phones are spread uniformly across the territory, a bunch of weaker transceivers will be able to handle far more simultaneous calls than one big one. Car phones, for example, were first deployed by the Bell System in St. Louis in 1946 and initially supported only three channels.  The capacity of such systems did increase; however, the infrastructure could not keep up with the demand.  If you imagine the demand within a large urban centre like New York City, something had to change.  The change that enabled today’s accessibility to mobile communication was the \"divide and cooperate\" (rather than conquer) enabled by the \"cell\" based approach. More text to come ….

The phone could last for about 30 minutes of talk time. Motorola spent $100 million and over 10 years developing the device. Despite the high price tag, poor battery life, heavy weight, and all its other flaws (at least compared to modern devices), the DynaTAC mobile phone was wildly successful: waiting lists numbered in the thousands. By 1990, the old AMPS networks were replaced by Digital AMPS (D-AMPS). By 2008, all AMPS service was shut down across North America, marking the end of an era.",

To add to the unconventional nature of this device, one enters text via these two joysticks by means of something called radial menus, one for each hand.  And, in keeping with many keyboards, such as those with an integrated touch pad, the OrbiTouch also enables mouse like capabilities, such as pointing and selecting, also by means of one of the joysticks.",
        "buxton_notes": "Keyboards, Joysticks and Hierarchic Radial Menus Introduction When you first look at this device, you might guess that it is some kind of keyboard.  It even says so on the box and on the device itself.  The keyboard-like footprint might reinforce this notion, as might the alphanumeric characters in the grey ring around the circular orb on the right-hand.  On the other hand, if this is a keyboard, where are the keys? Reading the labels more carefully sheds light on the paradox: there are none.  This is a \"keyless keyboard.\" Yes, this is a contradiction in terms. But it is just such curiosities that make devices like this potentially interesting.  Hence, we shall take a reasonably deep dive to see what might be revealed. Let’s start by trying to understand what the rationale was for landing on this particular design. The orbiTouch was developed by an industrial engineering doctoral student at the University of Central Florida, Peter McAlindon.  His goal was to develop a means of text entry that minimized hand and wrist motion.  The intent was to reduce the incidence of repetitive stress injury.  A fair bit of research was undertaken between initial concept and commercial release. This can be accessed online, and doing so is a worthwhile exercise. Let us now turn our eye to the physical device in order to get a sense of where all of this landed. The Physical Device The orbiTouch is dominated by two large circular \"orbs.\"  To my eye, their form initially practically screamed out, \"I am a rotary control - Turn me!\"  However, appearances can be deceptive. Rather than dials, the orbs turn out to be a pair of a joysticks of a particular type. Rather than the stick-tilting motion typical of most, these \"joysticks\" are operated by moving them along the horizontal plane.  In this they are a close cousins of the Altra Felix and KA Design Turbo Puck, both also in the collection.  However, in contrast with the Felix and Turbo Puck, whose handles are \"floating\" (if you let go, they remain in the position where you released your grip), the orbs are \"self-centering.\" That is, when released, internal springs return the orbs to their neutral central \"home\" position.  In this, they behave much like the Gravis joystick in the collection, for example. At a finer level of detail, the orbs are specific class of joystick: \"8-way joy-switches\".  The term\"8-way\" indicates that only movement along the 8 main axes of the compass are sensed.   As to the word \"switch\", think of each orb as 8 switches, any one of which can be turned on by moving the orb in one of the 8 directions.  (Conversely, they are turned off when the orb is released and returns to home position). Unlike an analogue joystick, such switches do not, and cannot, report how far or fast the orb has moved in any particular direction, nor how much pressure might be applied in the process.  While limited, joy-switches provide a less complex and lower cost solution that are appropriate in situations where this additional data is not needed.  There are several examples of joy-switches in the collection, especially video game controllers.  One of the most iconic examples is the Atari CX-40 controller, which is a 4-way joy-switch. To recap, the orbiTouch is a bi-manual device for entering text by means of two orb-shaped planer-moving 8-way self-centering joy-switches. Having swallowed that mouth-full, let us now explore how text is entered using such a transducer. Entering Text In general, a character or function is input by moving the two orbs.  Which character or function depends on the direction (if any) each of the orbs has moved.  For example, if both the left and right orb move west (left), the character \"a\" is entered.  On the other hand, if the right orb again moves west, but the left one east (right), then the character input is \"e\". How or why this is the case can be explained with the help of some images.  For easier reading, the figure below shows the labels around the orbs in an exploded view.  Notice that for both orbs, there is a label segment for each of its 8 directions. Since the example discussed entering an \"a\" and an \"e\", each of which involved the right orb moving west (left) let’s look at the associated label segment in even more detail. Like all of the label segments for the right orb, this one consists of six areas containing text, each with a distinct background colour: red, yellow, green, orange and blue for the letters A through E, respectively, and black for the region containing \"BACKSPACE\". Now look again at previous image and notice that each of these colours matches the label associated with one of the directions of the left orb. Text is entered using a two part process. Moving the right orb to the left/west specifies that you are going to enter one of:  a, b, c, d, e, or BACKSPACE. (Like most keyboards, despite the labels on the key-caps being upper case, lower-case characters are entered unless the shift key is depressed.) Moving the left orb in the direction whose label corresponds to the background colour of the desired character causes that character to be entered. Hence, with the right orb held in the left/west position, one can enter the sequence, \"abcde\", followed by a Backspace, by sequentially moving the left orb west (red), north-west (yellow), north (green), north-east (orange), east (blue) and south (black). The same technique can then be used to access all the characters and commands found in the right orb’s labels. Special Modes There is one thing to add at this point: While entering printing characters always requires the use of both orbs, some actions can be performed using the left orb only.  This can be inferred by the text that accompanies some of the left orb’s labels.  For example, moving the left orb north (green) in quick succession (analogous to a double-click on a mouse), indicates that SHIFT will apply to the next character entered.  Likewise, doing the same thing in the south-west (grey) direction applies the Caps Lock mode, i.e., SHIFT will be applied to all subsequent entries until the mode is cancelled. These one-handed special modes/functions are summarized in the image below. Of these, the only one that I want to discuss at the moment is the ability of the orbiTouch to switch from entering text to controlling the screen cursor.  This is done by moving the left orb south (black) twice in quick succession.   When this is done, the right orb controls the cursor movement - the cursor moves continuously in the direction that you move the orb.  In this, any doubts that you had about me characterizing the orbs as joysticks should disappear, since this cursor control is classic joystick behaviour.  One issue of note is that the label describes this as \"mouse\" not \"joystick\", which while understandable, is incorrect. Finally, before moving on to the next topic, note that while the right orb controls the movement of the screen cursor in mouse mode, movement of the left or left/west or right/east is taken as a left and right mouse button press, respectively. Remembering that the premise here is that the hands don’t have to move from the orbiTouch in order switch between typing and pointing tasks.  But that doesn’t mean that the overhead in switching between the tasks is removed.  One type of overhead is just substituted for another.  And, the moded nature of the orbiTouch means that the option of parallel pointing-typing actions are eliminated.  Rather than criticism, I mention these points to indicate the need to be mindful of the trade-offs and consequences of different design decisions - consequences that the designer should be aware of. Going Meta:  What’s Really Going On? I want to approach doing so by stepping back, and approaching the underlying method of \"typing\" by going \"meta\".  That is, I want to jump up a lever of abstraction, beyond the physical device (for the moment), and explain what is going on at the conceptual level. The rest of the text is in much rougher form …. What will be revealed, if we do so, is that text is entered by means of the parallel use of two 8-direction radial menus. So what is a radial menu?  These are the neglected cousins of the linear menus that populate conventional graphical user interfaces.  The difference is that one makes a selection by the direction of movement, rather than the distance (as in the case with linear menus).  It turns out that people can learn these quickly if the directions correspond to the 8 main points of the compass.  For example, in a program menu, moving up (North) might mean Print, down (South) could mean Save, and moving down to the right (South East), Save As.    Like linear menus, these menus can also be hierarchic.  So, for example, after moving South East in order to specify Save As, a stroke to the left (West) might mean that it should be saved as a PDF file, whereas it would be saved as a Plain Text file if the secondary connected stroke was to the right (East). The reason for this brief tutorial on radial menus is that they pretty much define at the conceptual level how text is entered using the orbiTouch.  The eight directions that you can move the orbs defines the menu item selected.  And, by having the actual output depending on the combination of the selection made by each of the two orbs, the device can perhaps be best described as entering text using a two-level hierarchic radial menu, where menu selections are made using two planar moving 8-way joy switches.  That is quite a mouth-full, and it has taken all of the text above to bring us to the point where there is a reasonable chance that it makes sense.  And we still haven’t gotten into the details! it uses hierarchic (2-level) radial menus, but where the hierarchy is space multiplexed, rather than time multiplexed.  That is, rather than doing one menu selection after the other, you do them simultaneously, by using a different hand to articulate the selection from each of the two menus. (While the text on the description is sparse still, look at the training cards, etc. and the photos on the page.) At the level of the mental model, there is no question in my mind (actually, I shouldn’t say that, because I am supposed to be an objective researcher who needs empirical data to inform decisions, but what the hell!) that you could give someone who knew how to use this device two isotonic joysticks, such as used with a video game controller, and they would be able to enter text just as fast as with this device.  Furthermore, I am sure that if one had a slate capable of sensing both touch and stylus simultaneously, I am certain that the skill would transfer equally to using a touch radial gesture in the non-dominant hand, and stylus (or touch) radial gesture with the other. At the basic level, it is a 2-level radial menu, but where each level is operated independently and quasi-simultaneously by a different one of the operator’s two hands. Level 1:  Right Hand This lets the operator select one of eight regions The label for each region consists of 6 characters (5 printing and one \"special) In selecting one of the regions, one is not selecting any one of the characters of that region;  rather, they are just indicating that the character that they want is one of the six in that region Each of the characters in a region has a different background colour:  blue, orange, green, yellow, red and black. Level 2:  Left Hand This lets the operator select one of eight regions Each region is labeled by a single colour Among the colours that label the eight regions are the same ones used as character background colours in the regions of the right-hand control: blue, orange, green, yellow, red and black By the left hand selecting one of these six colours, one indicates which character is to be entered from among the six characters in the region indicated by the right hand - the selected character being the one whose background colour corresponds to the colour selected by the left hand. Hence, there are two 8-way, single level radial menus used.  I believe it fair to say that it is, nevertheless, a 2 level radial menu, since both need to be used in order to enter one token. In actual fact, things are more complex, since none of the above covers issues such as all of the special character, punctuation, etc., that do not appear on the labels of the right hand.  To keep things brief, this is why only 6 of the left-hand menu options are used in what is discussed above.  The other two options are needed to fill in the gaps.  And, even then, the device resorts to something like double-clicks to get special modes and capabilities.  For example, double clicking the black (south) region of the left hand turns the right-hand dome into a pointing device, i.e., a mouse substitute for pointing, etc. I went through the - as it turned out - interesting exercise of translating the two parallel depth-1 radial menus of the orbiTouch UI into two different depth-2, breadth-8 hierarchic radial menus.  You can see them in the attached images.  The one assumes that the LH \"dome\" as the first-level selection, and then make the second-level selection with the right-hand dome.  The other does the opposite, i.e., the right-hand dome selection is the first level. It is interesting to compare the two with each other, as well as with both the labeling on the orbiTouch and the Quickstart documentation: The RH level-1 version seems easier to get rudimentary understanding compared to the LH due to clustering of letters and numbers on outer menus. Likewise, for the special characters that are the upper case of the numbers The physical device is fine for letting you hunt-and-peck, so to speak, for characters, but it is useless for numbers, and most special characters. The documentation provided with the Quick Start (attached is not especially useful in terms of providing heuristics for memorization. While the orbiTouch certainly uses radial menus, it decidedly does not employ marking menus.  One of the key things missing is the ability to check and correct before committing to an input, and the lack of ability to backtrack to the start, and therefore abort without entering anything. One thing that I have learned from this exercise is the difference that results due to having self-returning joysticks.  Gestures don’t have that attribute.  It matters esp w.r.t. the last point. What I like about this story, is how looking at something seemingly very different at the right level of abstraction, teaches us/me something new about something I was supposed to be an expert in.  That is, that 2-level hierarchic marking menus can be achieved by two simultaneous single-level MMs.  This is why I have the collection, and why I love what I do.  There is still delight, despite being a 63-year-old geezer grandfather.

        "short_description": "The CyKey is a one-hand chord keyboard that uses the six-key codes of the Microwriter and AgendA.  Extra keys enable it to be used with either hand.  Intended for use with a personal computer or PDA.",
        "buxton_notes": "Originally released in 1996, the CyKey was a designed as an inexpensive means to enable people to employ the chording technique originally developed for the Microwriter to enter alphanumeric data into a PC or PDA, such as a Palm Pilot. One could always enter data to your PC using the serial connector.  However, that was cumbersome, and, it required an entire Microwriter, rather than just a keypad, which is what the CyKey provided. The other thing that the CyKey brought to the equation was the ability to use it with either the left or the right hand.  Hence, despite the additional keys on the keypad, it used the standard Microwriter codes.  The extra keys were to accommodate left or right-handed use on the same physical device, and to compensate for the slight asymmetry in the Microwriter (and AgendA) keyboard layouts. As Chris Rainey, the designer of the CyKey explained to me: In an updated CyKey it was apparent that the original design of the CyKey was rather clunky and was done on a shoe-string. During the life of the product it was criticized for being rather large, noisy (clicking keys), a left hand version was a special; the cable connecting the unit to the PC was a nuisance. In order to address the problem, the Mk 2 CyKey specification evolved. The size was set by using the ergonomics that were so successful on the AgendA. So the basic key set up of the AgendA set the position of the CyKey keys. The AgendA keys can be superimposed on the CyKey. To address the problem of having the single unit for LH and RH operation I noted that a mirror of the AgendA key meant that we had 2 little finger keys and the key had to be elongated to accommodate the asymmetry of the AgendA keys. This turned out so be advantageous as it gave a bigger surface area and gave 2 keys with which you can press with the little finger, thereby answering a further problem which is that young children had a job spanning the full keyboard. The cable was done away with by using IR (this was chosen as it has the potential to be very low power - 12 months + battery life). A lot of work was carried out to ensure that the error rate was very low by having a strong error-checking algorithm.",

        "title": "Xerox PARC 5-Key Chord Keyboard",
        "short_description": "This five-button chord keyboard was modeled on the keyboard developed by Doug Engelbart, and publicly demonstrated in his 1968 \"Mother of all demos\".  It was fitted to the first Xerox Alto computers, with an accompanying 3-button mouse,and like with Engelbart, it was intended for use by the non-mouse hand.  This enabled each hand to be in \"home position\" on two different, but complementary devices, thus keeping core functionality such as text entry, editing, invoking special functions, etc. efficiently \"in hand\".",
        "buxton_notes": "This device grew out of pioneering work undertaken at the Augmentation Research Center of the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) in the 1960s.  This is the work which laid much of the foundation for the Graphical User Interface (GUI), also known as WIMP (Windows, Icons, Mouse, Pointer) interfaces which dominated interaction design from the l980s right up to the present. This work was mainly driven by Douglas Engelbart, with strong contributions from William English, and was called the NLS System (oN-Line System).  Its first major public demonstration took place at the annual Fall Joint Computer Conference in San Francisco December 9th, 1968.  Its impact was such that one of the pioneers of computer graphics, Andries van Dam, referred to it as \"The Mother of All Demos\", a name which has stuck.  Watch the video in the references section and you will see why. In the realm of human-computer interaction, the NLS system developed by Engelbart and English (1968) is important to our discussion.  This is the project that introduced the mouse, and therefore had a huge impact on multiple generations of computer users.  What is easily missed, however, is that the goals of this work had nothing to do with improving access to computing for casual users or making computers easy to use.  Rather, they were designing a system with which highly trained operators could reach their full potential.  By analogy, they were designing a violin for a virtuoso performer, rather than a player of the 2005 videogame Guitar Hero, which is kind of like guitar karaoke for the amateur.  It is somewhat ironic, therefore, that the mouse was adopted by novices far faster and enthusiastically than by the power-users targeted by the NLS project.   For a long time, they clung to keyboard-based command-line interfaces. Stepping back, from the perspective of input, the NLS system pursued a bi-manual approach that employed three main devices: A conventional QWERTY keyboard A three-button mouse A five-button chord Keyboard. These are illustrated in Figure 1. Figure 1: The NLS Input Devices This image is a frame from the film of the \"Mother of all demos\", the demonstration of Engelbart and English’s work that accompanied their classic 1968 paper at the Fall Joint Computer Conference. Left-to-right one sees the left hand on the chord keyboard, the QWERTY keyboard in the middle, and the mouse in the right hand.  Note that the mouse is not the original one-button wooden mouse shown in Figure 5 of Chapter 2.  Rather, it is a three-button mouse - a fact which is important to our discussion. The use of the mouse and QWERTY keyboard was similar to that common to the graphical user interfaces that have been around since the early-to-mid 1980s.   The mouse was typically operated by the dominant hand and used for spatial tasks such as graphically pointing and selecting.   The QWERTY keyboard was used for sustained text entry.  It is in the five-button chording keyboard that we begin to encounter something less familiar.  Since there are a few surprises here, I’m going to go into a bit of detail about its use. With just a keyboard and a mouse, the two most typical strategies for entering text are: Bring both hands to the QWERTY keyboard and type quickly, then have one hand move back to the mouse to perform pointing, selection or dragging tasks. Keep one hand on the mouse, and type very slowly by tapping on the keyboard using the hand not operating the mouse. The 5-key piano-like chording keyboard was developed to provide a third alternative - one that enabled text to be entered with the one hand to remain on the mouse and the other on the chord keyboard. On the plus side, by enabling the hands to remain in \"home position\" on the mouse and chord keyboard, the transaction cost of moving the hands back and forth between them and the accompanying standard QWERTY keyboard (the \"homing time\") was eliminated. For skilled users, this was significantly faster than option (b) above, typing with one hand on the QWERTY keyboard. On the other hand, typing in this manner was still significantly slower than option (a), typing with both hands on the QWERTY keyboard.  Hence, the savings offered by this option (c) only occurred when typing short bits of text.  For longer blocks of text, the cost of moving to and from the conventional keyboard was easily made up for by the increased typing speed. Despite my describing this third option in terms of the bi-manual simultaneous use of mouse and keyboard, Engelbart & English (1968) refer to it as \"one-handed typing.\" This description gives cause to dive more deeply into what was going on, since it has given rise to a mistaken belief that typing in this mode employed only the chord keyboard, and that the role of the mouse was solely for complementary spatial pointing related tasks.   That is not accurate. Yes, many things could be typed using just one hand using the 5-button keyboard. But so to can a violinist play music using only one of the four strings on the instrument.   While some music can be played, the full repertoire cannot.  Likewise, using a chord keyboard to access the full character set found on a standard QWERTY keyboard, using only a single chord for each character, this mode of entering text requires seven keys, just as the violin needs four strings. Used alone, the keys of the 5-button chord keyboard are simply not adequate for the task. Why? Five binary keys mean that only 25-1 = 31 different characters can be entered.  So, as he designed it, yes, Engelbart could enter the 26 lower-case letters of the alphabet and five other characters:  comma, period, semicolon, question mark, and SPACE using just the five keys of the chord keyboard. However, to enter the rest of the character set - such as the upper-case letters of the alphabet, digits, numerical operations, additional punctuation and special characters - two more buttons were required.  These were provided by the left and middle buttons of the three-button mouse. In effect, Engelbart used a virtual 7-button chord keyboard split over two different physical devices, and effectively, a 1-button mouse.  This gave him access to a full repertoire of 27-1 = 127 different characters.  The question is, how did he map the chord combinations onto the character set? The short answer - at least for those with some background in computer science - is that he used a clever variation of 7-bit ASCII. The table in the accompanying figure will help provide a more complete explanation. Engelbart and English Chord Keyboard Encoding Scheme This table shows how the 5 buttons on the chord keyboard and 2 mouse buttons were used to enter text.  (Based on Engelbart, 1973). The main table in the Figure has 32 rows. Each of the 32 rows in the main table represents one of the unique combinations in which the five buttons of the chord keyboard can be depressed. Each of the five left-most columns corresponds to one of the five buttons on the chord keyboard. A \"1\" in a cell indicates that the key associated with that column is depressed in the chord associated what that specific row.  For example, the key associated with the left-most column is only depressed in the chords represented by rows 17 to 32.  Likewise, the top row indicates the situation where none of the five keys are depressed. If only the chord keyboard is used, the character that is entered for any of the 31 possible chords (rows 2 -32) is shown in the corresponding row in the 6th column, labeled \"State 1\". If the middle mouse button is depressed, the character entered is determined by which, if any, of the 5 chord keyboard buttons are also depressed, and is indicated in the corresponding row in the 7th column, labeled \"State 2\". If the left mouse button is pushed, it works the same way, except the character entered is indicated in the corresponding row in the column labeled \"State 3\". Finally, if both the left and middle mouse buttons are depressed simultaneously, then the character is likewise determined by which, if any, of the 5 chord keyboard buttons are depressed, and indicated in the corresponding row in the column labeled \"State 4\". To wrap up the explanation of how the buttons of the chord keyboard and the mouse relate to the table: The illustration on the Chord Keyboard at the bottom right of Figure 3 indicates which bit (1-5) is associated with which key, and therefore which key corresponds to each of the first five columns in the table. The illustration of the mouse in the middle right of the figure shows the labelling of the buttons (1-3), and which of the seven bits (6 & 7) is mapped to which button.  These two bits do not map directly into columns in the table, hence the next point. For the readers who are computer scientists:  the small table at the top on the right-hand side shows how Engelbart remapped the meaning of bits 6 and 7, compared to 7-bit ascii.  This was clever, since it gave him access to the lower-case alphabet using only the 5 least significant bits, i.e., using just the buttons on the chord keyboard. Using the limited character set available with just the 5-button chording keyboard, Engelbart was reported to have been able to achieve a typing speed of 35 words per minute with his right hand, and 25 words per minute with his left. It is also reported that it took him about 10 hours to reach 10 words per minute (Noyes, 1983). Remember, the speeds reported above included only 31 of the 127 of the full character set.  His typing speed would have been slower if he was employing both hands, and it would take far more than 10 hours to learn them all.  However, there was always the option to revert to the QWERTY keyboard - which was frequently done.  As stated in Engelbart and English (1968): One-handed typing with the handset is slower than two-handed typing with the standard keyboard. However, when the user works with one hand on the handset and one on the mouse, the coordinated interspersion of control characters and short literal strings from one hand with mouse control actions from the other yields considerable advantage in speed and smoothness of operation. For literal strings longer than about ten characters, one tends to transfer from the handset to the normal keyboard. Both from general experience and from specific experiment, it seems that enough skill to make its use worthwhile can generally be achieved with about five hours of practice. Beyond this, skill grows with usage. Given the historical importance of this system, I have gone into so much detail about the text entry because it is so difficult to extract from the literature. By the same token, the exercise helps build a stronger sense of how important such details are in terms of the ultimate user experience.  No matter how good any of the chord keyboards discussed look or feel mechanically, the complexity of the encoding scheme - how long it takes to learn, the proneness of error, or the speed of entry, may dominate the value. Finally, the 5-button chord keyboard was not only used for entering text.  At Xerox PARC, where this particular example originated, its buttons were also used as function keys.  That is, special functions were assigned o specific individual keys, or combinations of keys.  Furthermore, these function keys were sometimes used in combination (either in sequence or chording) with other keys on the QWERTY keyboard - which retained the bimanual benefits, but this time between the two keyboards, rather than the 5-button keyboard and the mouse which Englebart demonstrated. This type of usage can be seen in the video demo by Larry Tessler of the Gypsy text editor, accessible from the link below.  Furthermore, an explanation of the use of the chord keyboard, referred to as the \"five-key keyset\" in the document, by the description of Gypsy in the 1975 report by Tessler and Mott, accessed from the link below.",

It was produced by Kye Systems Corp. of Taiwan and released under two different names. Under the Mouse Systems Brand (which Kye had acquired in 1990), it was released as the ProAgio! Mouse, or Scroll Mouse.  Under the Genius brand, it was called the EasyProAgio. The versions in the collection are from Mouse Systems.",
        "buxton_notes": "The ProAgio mouse was, to the best of my knowledge, the first commercially available scroll-wheel mouse.  That is, a mouse which - beside enabling pointing, selecting, dragging, etc., also incorporated a wheel which - when rolled in one direction or another with one of the fingers or the thumb - enabled a document to be scrolled up or down, or for example, and image to be scaled. Besides incorporating a scroll wheel, the ProAgio had five buttons.  Across the top were the left, middle and right mouse buttons typically found on PC mice.  (Macintosh mice at the time only had one button.) The fourth button was incorporated into the scroll wheel itself.  It was activated by pushing the scroll-wheel down, and scrolling could be performed with the button depressed or not, thereby enabling different scrolling modes.  Finally, running along its left side was the fifth button. This was designed to be operated by the thumb (thereby reflecting a right-hand bias in its industrial design). Clicking this let one cycle through the currently open applications, one click at a time.  Alternatively, while holding the side button, one could scroll through the open applications to select the one desired. While the ProAgio was the first scroll-wheel mouse commercially available, it was not the first to be publicly shown. That distinction belongs to the Apple Scroll Wheel mouse prototype designed by Gina Venolia and shown in 1989. In 2012 Gina built a replica of that first scroll-wheel mouse and donated it to the collection. Hence, here we have yet another example of the \"Long Nose of Innovation.\" There were six years between Venolia’s prototype demonstration and the commercial release of the ProAgio.  And despite the first prototype being developed at Apple, it took them 16 years before they released a mouse with integrated scrolling -  their 2005 Mighty Mouse (which is also in the collection)!",

        "short_description": "The M-1 is a commercial version of one of the two first optical mice.  To work, it needed to be used on a special rigid reflective mouse pad.  A fine graphical grid was embedded in the mouse pad, and the movement of the mouse was sensed by the two optical sensors in the bottom of the mouse, detecting the direction and amount of movement.  The grid sensing enabled another capability which was a unique at the time: the ability to sense rotation of the mouse, as well as its horizontal and vertical movement on the pad.",
        "buxton_notes": "Put There were multiple versions of the M-1, some under the Mouse Systems brand, such as this one, while others under the brand of the company which they were sold to, such as Sun Microsystems and VisiCorp (for use with their \"killer app\" spreadsheet program, VisiCalc. The M-1 is distinguished by requiring its own power-supply.  Also, the original Mouse Systems M-1 was black with white buttons.  It was further distinguished by the typography of the company name, as seen on the accompanying photos, and the absence of any graphics with the logo. In 1983, the M-1 was being sold as the PC Mouse.  The marketing collateral switched the typography of Mouse Systems, and included a wedge of cheese icon to the right of the name.",

        "short_description": "The OLPC XO-1 is very innovative device that nevertheless raises serious issues about technology and social responsibility.  It is included in the collection primarily as a warning against technological hubris, and the fact that no technologies are neutral from a social-cultural perspective.",
        "buxton_notes": "Introduction I have this computer in my collection as a reminder of the delicate relationship between object and purpose, and how no matter how well one does on the former, it will likely have no impact on making a wanting concept achieve the stated (and even valid) purpose any better.   I include it in the collection as a cautionary tale of how the object may help sell a concept, regardless how ill-conceived - even to those who should know better, had they applied the most basic critical thinking. For consumers, investors and designers, its story serves as a cautionary reminder to the importance of cultivating and retaining a critical mind and questioning perspective, regardless of how intrinsically seductive or well-intentioned a technology may be. From the perspective of hardware and software, what the One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) project was able to accomplish is impressive.  In general, the team delivered a computer that could be produced at a remarkably low price - even if about double that which was targeted.  Specifically, the display, for example, is innovative, and stands out due to its ability to work both in the bright sun (reflective) as well as in poorly lit spaces (emissive) - something that goes beyond pretty much anything else that is available on today’s (2017) slate computers or e-readers.  In short, some excellent work went into this machine, something that is even more impressive, given the nature of the organization from which it emerged. The industrial design was equally impressive.  Undertaken by Yves Behar’s Fuseproject Ultimately, however, the machine was a means to an end, not the end itself.  Rather than a device, the actual mission of the OLPC project was: … to empower the world's poorest children through education. Yet, as described by in their materials, the computer was intended to play a key role in this: With access to this type of tool [the computer], children are engaged in their own education, and learn, share, and create together. They become connected to each other, to the world and to a brighter future. Hence, making a suitable computer suitable to that purpose and the conditions where it would be used, at a price point that would enable broad distribution, was a key part of the project. The Underlying Belief System of the OLPC Project Since they are key to the thinking behind the OLPC project, I believe if fair to frame my discussion around the following four questions: Will giving computers to kids in the developing world improve their education? Will having a thus better-educated youth help bring a society out of poverty? Can that educational improvement be accomplished by giving the computers to the kids, with no special training for teachers? Should this be attempted on a global scale without any advance field trials or pilot studies? From the perspective of the OLPC project, the answer to every one of these questions is an unequivocal \"yes\".  In fact, as we shall see, any suggestion to the contrary is typically answered by condescension and/or mockery.  The answers appear to be viewed as self-evident and not worth even questioning. Those who have not subscribed to this doctrine might call such a viewpoint hubris. What staggers me is how the project got so far without the basic assumptions being more broadly questioned, much less such questions being seriously addressed by the proponents.  How did seemingly otherwise people commit to the project, through their labour or financial investment, given the apparently naïve and utopian approach that it took?  Does the desire to do good cloud judgment that much?  Are we that dazzled by a cool technology or big hairy audacious goal?  Or by a charismatic personality? To explain my concern, and what this artifact represents to me, let me just touch on the four assumptions on which the project was founded. Will giving computers to kids in the developing world improve education? The literature on this question is, at best, mixed.  What is clear is that one cannot make any assumption that such improvements will occur, regardless of whether one is talking about the developing world or suburban USA.  For example, in January 2011, The World Bank published the following study: Can Computers Help Students Learn?  From Evidence to Policy, January 2011, Number 4, The World Bank. A public-private partnership in Colombia, called Computers for Education, was created in 2002 to increase the availability of computers in public schools for use in education. Since starting, the program has installed more than 73,000 computers in over 6,300 public schools in more than 1,000 municipalities. By 2008, over 2 million students and 83,000 teachers had taken part. This document reports on a two-year study to determine the impact of the program on student performance. Students in schools that received the computers and teacher training did not do measurably better on tests than students in the control group. Nor was there a positive effect on other measures of learning. Researchers did not find any difference in test scores when they looked at specific components of math and language studies, such as algebra and geometry, and grammar and paraphrase ability in Spanish. But report also notes that results of such studies are mixed: Studies on the relationship between using computers in the classroom and improved test scores in developing countries give mixed results: A review of Israel’s Tomorrow-98 program in the mid-1990s, which put computers in schools across the country, did not find any impact on math and Hebrew language scores. But in India, a study of a computer-assisted learning program showed a significant positive impact on math scores. One thing researchers agree on, more work is needed in this field. Before moving on, a search of the literature will show that these results are consistent with those that were available in the literature at the time that the project was started.  The point that I am making is not that the OLPC project could not be made to work; rather, that it was wrong to assume that it would do so without spending at least as much time designing the process to bring that about, as was expended designing the computer itself.  Risk is fine, and something that can be mitigated.  But diving in under the assumption that it would just work is not calculated risk, it is gambling - with other people’s lives, education and money. Will a better educated population help bring a society out of poverty? I am largely going to punt on this question.  The fact is, I would be hard pressed to argue against education. But let us grant that improving education in the developing world is a good thing.  The appropriate question is:  is the approach of the OLPC project a reasonable or responsible way to disburse the limited resources that are available to address the educational challenges of the developing world? At the very least, I would suggest that this is a topic worthy of debate.  An a priori assumption that giving computers is the right solution is akin to the, \"If you build it they will come\" approach seen in the movie, Field of Dreams. The problem here is that this is not a movie.  There are real lives and futures that are at stake here - lives of those who cannot afford to see the movie, much less have precious resources spent on projects that are not well thought through. Can that improvement be accomplished by just giving the computers to the kids without training teachers? Remarkably, the OLPC Project’s answer is an explicit, \"Yes\". In a TED talk filmed in December 2007, the founder of the OLPC initiative, Nicholas Negroponte states: \"When people tell me, you know, who’s going to teach the teachers to teach the kids, I say to myself, \"What planet do you come from?\"  Okay, there’s not a person in this room [the TED Conference], I don’t care how techy you are, there’s not a person in this room that doesn’t give their laptop or cell phone to a kid to help them debug it.  Okay, we all need help, even those of us who are very seasoned.\" Let us leave aside the naïvete of this statement stemming from the lack of distinction between ability to use applications and devices versus the ability to create and shape them.  A failure of logic remains in that those unseasoned kids are part of \"us\", as in \"we all need help\".  Where do the kids go for help?  To other kids?  What if they don’t know?  Often they won’t.  After all, the question may well have to do with a concept in calculus, rather than how to use the computer. What then? No answer is offered.  Rather, those who dare raise the serious and legitimate concerns regarding teacher preparation are mockingly dismissed as coming from another planet! Well, perhaps they are.  But in that case, there should at least be some debate as to who lives on which planet.  Is it the people raising the question or the one dismissing the concern that lives in the real world of responsible thought and action? Can this all be accomplished without any advance field trials?  Should one just immediately commit to international deployment of the program? As recently as September 2009, Negroponte took part in a panel discussion where he spoke on this matter. He states: I'd like you to imagine that I told you \"I have a technology that is going to change the quality of life.\" And then I tell you \"Really the right thing to do is to set up a pilot project to test my technology. And then the second thing to do is, once the pilot has been running for some period of time, is to go and measure very carefully the benefits of that technology.\" And then I am to tell you that what we are going to is very scientifically evaluate this technology, with control groups - giving it to some, giving it to others. And this all is very reasonable until I tell you the technology is electricity.  And you say \"Wait, you don't have to do that!\" But you don't have to do that with laptops and learning either. And the fact that somebody in the room would say the impact is unclear is to me amazing - unbelievably amazing. There's not a person in this room who hasn't bought a laptop for their child, if they could afford it. And you don't know somebody who hasn't done it, if they can afford it. So there's only one question on the table and that's, \"How to afford it?\" That's the only question. There is no other question - it's just the economics. And so, when One Laptop Per Child started, I didn't have the picture quite as clear as that, but we did focus on trying to get the price down. We did focus on those things. Unfortunately, Negroponte demonstrates his lack of understanding of both the history of electricity and education in this example.  His historical mistake is this:  yes, it was pretty obvious that electricity could bring many benefits to society.  But what happened when Edison did exactly what Negroponte advocates?  He almost lost his company due to his complete (but mistaken) conviction that DC, rather the AC was the correct technology to pursue. As with electricity, yes, it is rather obvious that education could bring significant benefits to the developing world.  But in order to avoid making the same kind of expensive mistake that Edison did, perhaps one might want to do one’s best to make sure that the chosen technology is the AC, rather than DC, of education. A little more research, and a little less hubris might have put the investments in Edison and the OLPC to much better use. But the larger question is this:  in what way is it responsible for the wealthy western world to advocate an untested and expensive (in every sense) technological solution on the poorest nations in the world? If history has taught us anything, it has taught us that just because our intentions are good, the same is not necessarily true for consequences of our actions. Later in his presentation, Negroponte states: … our problems are swimming against very naïve views of education. With this, I have to agree.  It is just whose views on education are naïve, and how can such views emerge from MIT, no less, much less pass with so little critical scrutiny by the public, the press, participants, and funders? In an interview with Paul Marks, published in the New Scientist in December 2008, we see the how the techno-centric aspect of the project plays into the ostensible human centric purpose of the project.  Negroponte’s retort regarding some of the initial skepticism that the project provoked was this: \"When we first said we could build a laptop for $100 it was viewed as unrealistic and so 'anti-market' and so 'anti' the current laptops which at the time were around $1000 each,\" Negroponte said. \"It was viewed as pure bravado - but look what happened: the netbook market has developed in our wake.\" The project's demands for cheaper components such as keyboards, and processors nudged the industry into finding ways to cut costs, he says. \"What started off as a revolution became a culture.\" Surprise, yes, computers get smaller, faster, and cheaper over the course of time, and yes, one can even grant that the OLPC project may have accelerated that inevitable move.  And, I have already stated my admiration and respect for the quality of the technology that was developed. But in the context of the overall objectives of the project, the best that one can say is, \"Congratulations on meeting a milestone.\"  However, by the same token, one might also legitimately question if starting with the hardware was not an instance of putting the cart before the horse. Yes, it is obviously necessary to have portable computers in the first place, before one can introduce them into the classroom, home, and donate them to children in the developing world. But it is also the case that small portable computers were already in existence and at the time that the project was initiated.  While a factor of ten more expensive than the eventual target price, they were both available and adequate to support limited preliminary testing of the underlying premises of the project in an affordable manner. That is, before launching into a major - albeit well-intentioned - hardware development project, it may have been prudent to have tested the underlying premises of its motivation. Here we have to return to the raison d’être of the initiative: … to empower the world's poorest children through education Hence, the extent to which this is achieved from a given investment must be the primary metric of success, as well as the driving force of the project.  Yet, that is clearly not what happened.  Driven by a blind Edisonian belief in their un-tested premise, the project’s investments were overwhelmingly on the side of technology rather than pedagogy. Perhaps the nature and extent of the naïve (but well-meaning) utopian dream underlying the project is captured in the last part of the interview, above: Negroponte believes that empowering children and their parents with the educational resources offered by computers and the Internet will lead to informed decisions that improve democracy. Indeed, it has led to some gentle ribbing between himself and his brother: John Negroponte - currently deputy secretary of state in the outgoing Bush administration and the first ever director of national intelligence at the National Security Agency. \"I often joke with John that he can bring democracy his way - and I'll bring it mine,\" he says. Apparently providing inexpensive laptops to children in the developing world is not only going to raise educational standards, eradicate poverty, it is also going to bring democracy!  All that, with no mention of the numerous poor non-democratic countries that have literacy levels equal to or higher than the USA (Cuba might be one reasonable example).  The words naïve technological-utopianism come to mind. I began by admitting that I was conflicted in terms of this project.  From the purely technological perspective, there is much to admire in the project’s accomplishments.  Sadly, that was not the project’s primary objective.  What appears to be missing throughout is an inability to distinguish between the technology and the purpose to which is was intended to serve. My concern in this regard is reflected in a paper by Warschauer & Ames(2010). The analysis reveals that provision of individual laptops is a utopian vision for the children in the poorest countries, whose educational and social futures could be more effectively improved if the same investments were instead made on more sustainable and proven interventions. Middle- and high-income countries may have a stronger rationale for providing individual laptops to children, but will still want to eschew OLPC’s technocentric vision. In summary, OLPC represents the latest in a long line of technologically utopian development schemes that have unsuccessfully attempted to solve complex social problems with overly simplistic solutions. There is a delicate relationship between technology and society, culture, ethics, and values.   What this case study reflects is the fact that technologies are not neutral.  They never are.  Hence, technological initiatives must be accompanied by appropriate social, cultural and ethical considerations - especially in projects such as this where the technologies are being introduced into particularly vulnerable societies.  That did not happen here, The fact that this project got the support that it did, and has gone as far as it has, given the way it was approached, is why this reminder - in the form of this device - is included in the collection.  And if anyone ever wonders why I am so vocal about the need for public discourse around technology, one need look no further than the OLPC project.",

        "buxton_notes": "The Nikon Coolpix 100 was the first in Nikon’s long Coolpix product line of digital cameras. It is also the second digital camera that I owned - the first being my 1994 Apple Quicktake 100.  It was released in 1997, and I found its design intriguing. While not quite as high resolution as the Quicktake 100 (512 x 480 vs 640 x 480), its convenience, size and simplicity appealed to me. It, still does. One reason is that it is self-contained.  It is the only non-wireless digital camera that I’ve had which didn’t require extra cables to connect it to my computer, or power supplied with which to recharge the batteries.  While not small by today’s standards, it nevertheless fit into my briefcase or pocket available to use.  And, because it had an integrated PCMCIA card, one just slid it into the card slot on one’s computer and the images were immediately accessible.  In so doing, it introduced many of the characteristics that made the more recent ill-fated Flip video camera so appealing. At a time when digital cameras needed serial cables to transfer images to computers, the Coolpix took a novel approach.  In today’s parlance, think of it as a camera attached to a USB memory stick (thumb drive), where the memory stick connector is normally sheathed in a battery pack.  When a picture is taken, it is stored on the memory stick.  To transfer the images to a computer, you just pull the camera-memory stick out of the battery-pack sheath and plug it into the USB port. The only thing was, there was no USB memory sticks, much less USB.  However, there was a larger kind of plug-in card called a PCMCIA card, one type of which was a 1 MB flash memory card.  That is what the Coolpix 100 used, as can be seen in the accompanying photographs.  The result was no need for cables (if one’s computer had a PCMCIA slot - which at the time most laptops did). Memory at the time was limited and expensive, so with only 1 MB of memory available, one had to make a trade-off between number of images versus their resolution.  The 1 MB of memory allowed for 42 \"normal\" quality images, or 21 \"fine\" ones.  Of course, what constituted \"fine\" quality then (512 x 480 pixels) was rather different than today. Like a traditional film camera, the camera had only an optical view finder.  Unlike most smartphones and digital cameras, one could not preview images on the camera itself.  That had to be done on a computer. There was an LCD display on the top, but this - along with a few buttons - was used for controlling the settings and providing various status information.  The camera had a built-in flash, which could be set to automatic (only flashed in low light), on, or off, as well as a pre-flash feature to reduce \"red eye\". There was also a built-in 10 second timer, date/time settings/display and the ability to view the number or remaining images.  One could delete existing images - but not being able to see which you were deleting on the camera, one had to do so by memory. For its time it was great. In today’s wireless mobile world, where my briefcase still has more than 4 times this camera’s volume in cables and power supplies to support the various \"must have\" gadgets demanded by my job, I often long for the less cluttered world which this camera’s design reflected. I also wish more gadgets today matched its ease of use. References",

        "buxton_notes": "From web site: The Novint Falcon is an entirely new type of game controller. Replacing your mouse or joystick, the Falcon is, essentially, a small robot that lets you experience true virtual touch unlike any controller in history. The Novint Falcon lets you control a game in three dimensions, and also lets you feel high-fidelity three-dimensional force feedback.
